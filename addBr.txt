The Tale of Cu Chulainn

In the sodden snow of the Irish hills
Was born a Tuatha's child
With a fighting heart and immortal skill
And a spirit fiery and wild

Through a prophecy he was bound and doomed
To a short and a glorious life
And he bore the name Setanta till
A famous fateful night

With his hurley in his hands
His name would cross the land

Well his Uncle Connor who wore the crown
Of Ulster on his head
In the home of Culainn the smith sat down
For mead and mutton and bread

At the door lay the Cú, the faithful hound
A huge and and terrible beast
When a thief or enemy trod his ground
Their bones became his feast

Well Setanta joined them late at night
And the hound it leapt to shred
But he raised his hurley, pucked the ball
Right through the poor beast's head

He spoke remorse as the smith he cried
For his lost and murdered hound
'I will be your Cú now from this night
Till another you have found'

So he lay outside the door
One eye watching on the moors

And the name Cú Chulainn
Was sung out loud that night
In a tale of rage and ruin and of might
And the name Cú Chulainn
So furious and wild
To remain in myth and memory
A legend of the isle

He trained on the Isle of Sky and Shadow
Bore an abandoned son
And met his battle brother Ferdiad
Many a tale they spun

Well he fought with the strength of many men
A beast who bloodied the fields
In a bloodlust battle frenzy
His skin would shift and peel

His son would find him as man
But would not tell his name
So he took a spear to his own child
And doomed himself to shame

When the canny Queen Méabh attacked his land
To steal the bull of brown
She sent out Ferdiad to fight
Cú Chualainn struck him down

Blood of son and brother fell
He wailed and cried farewell

And the name Cú Chulainn
Was sung out loud that night
In a tale of rage and ruin and of might
And the name Cú Chulainn
So furious and wild
To remain in myth and memory
A legend of the isle

When the father of fair Emer
Refused to give her to wed
Cú Chulainn tore his castle down
And left the whole place dead

They loved eachother, man and wife
Despite his many affairs
Then he met the Morrigan, turned her down
And earned her vengeful glare

She weakened him and broke his strength
With trickery and lies
By feeding him the flesh of dogs
Three crones were her disguise

The Queen and Lugaid saw their chance
To fight the Cú and win
When he battled next 3 spears were thrown
And one tore through his skin

So he tied himself to a mighty stone
By his guts and belt he hung
And so he still stood on his feet
Till the last breath it left his lungs

And a light shone out so grand
Till the raven came to land

And the name Cú Chulainn
Was sung out loud that night
In a tale of rage and ruin and of might
And the name Cú Chulainn
So furious and wild
To remain in myth and memory
A legend of the isle

MEANING
The song tells the legend of the Celtic warrior hero of Irish mythology.
The song tells of his birth in the hills of Ireland, his upbringing and training on the Isle of Sky and Shadow, his exploits including challenges with his Uncle Connor,
defeating the monstrous hound of Culainn, and defending Ulster from the Queen Méabh, his brief but intense romance with Emer, and ultimately his death by the hand of Lugaid.
Despite his shortened life, Cú Chulainn is remembered for his courage and legendary skill, to this day. The song wants to pay tribute to this iconic Celtic hero
and celebrate the legend of Cú Chulainn as a timeless reminder of courage, strength, and honour.
RIMANDO LETTERARIO:
Cú Chulainn, called the Hound of Ulster, is a warrior hero and demigod in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology,
as well as in Scottish and Manx folklore. He is believed to be an incarnation of the Irish god Lugh, who is also his father.
His mother is the mortal Deichtine, sister of king Conchobar mac Nessa.

Born Sétanta, he gained his better-known name as a child, after killing Culann's fierce guard dog in self defence
and offering to take its place until a replacement could be raised, so he became the "Hound (cú) of Culann".
He was trained in martial arts by Scáthach, who gave him the spear Gáe Bulg. It was prophesied that his great feats would give him everlasting fame,
but that his life would be short. At the age of seventeen he defended Ulster single-handedly against the armies of queen Medb of Connacht in the famous Táin Bó Cúailnge
("Cattle Raid of Cooley"). He is known for his terrifying battle frenzy (ríastrad), in which he becomes an unrecognisable monster who knows neither friend or enemy.
He fights from his chariot, driven by his loyal charioteer Láeg and drawn by his horses, Liath Macha and Dub Sainglend.

Cú Chulainn's wife is Emer, although he has many other lovers.
With Aífe he has a son named Connla, whom Cú Chulainn tragically kills. Cú Chulainn himself is said to have died in battle,
binding himself to a standing stone so he can die on his feet. He later became an icon for Irish nationalists.
