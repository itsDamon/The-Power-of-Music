The song "Guerrilla Radio" by Rage Against the Machine is about the struggle of the oppressed in society and their struggle to make
their voice heard against the oppressors. The text implies a revolution of the silent masses,
and that the only way to make your voice heard is through a "guerrilla radio", or unconventional methods of communication.
In the song, the speaker encourages the listener to join their cause and use music and communication
as a means to free himself from the constraints of the "brutal farce". The song also serves as a call to arms,
urging the people to fight for what is right and establish an environment of equality.
The House adopted a non-binding resolution on the situation in the Middle East.
Finally, the song sends a message of hope, insisting that with the right tools and push, a revolution is possible and that "all hell cannot stop us now".

rage against the machine - guerrilla radio

Transmission third world war third round
A decade of the weapon of sound above ground
No shelter if you're lookin' for shade
I lick shots at the brutal charade
As the polls close like a casket
On truth devoured
A Silent play in the shadow of power
A spectacle monopolized
The camera's eyes on choice disguised
Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?
Yes a spectacle monopolized
They hold the reins and stole your eyes
Or the fistagons
The bullets and bombs
Who stuff the banks
Who staff the party ranks
More for Gore or the son of a drug lord
None of the above fuck it cut the cord
Lights out
Guerrilla Radio, turn that shit up
Lights out
Guerrilla Radio, turn that shit up
Lights out
Guerrilla Radio, turn that shit up
Lights out
Guerrilla Radio
Contact I highjacked the frequencies
Blockin' the beltway
Move on D.C.
Way past the days of Bombin' M.C.'s
Sound off Mumia gwan be free
Who gottem yo check the federal file
All you pen devils know the trial was vile
An army of pigs try to silence my style
Off 'em all out that box
It's my radio dial
Lights out
Guerrilla Radio, turn that shit up
Lights out
Guerrilla Radio, turn that shit up
Lights out
Guerrilla Radio, turn that shit up
Lights out
Guerrilla Radio, turn that shit up
It has to start somewhere, it has to start sometime
What better place than here, what better time than now?
All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now
All hell can't stop us now
