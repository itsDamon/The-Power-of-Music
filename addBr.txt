Right about now NWA court is in full effect
Judge Dre presiding in the case of NWA versus the police department.
Prosecuting attourneys are MC Ren, Ice Cube and Eazy ***â€™ E
Order, order, order, Ice Cube take the ***' stand
Do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth
And nothin' but the truth so help your black ***?
You goddamn right
Well, won't you tell everybody what the *** you gotta say?
*** the police comin' straight from the underground
A Young *** got it bad 'cause I'm brown
And not the other color so police think
They have the authority to kill a minority
*** that shit, 'cause I ain't the one
For a punk ***  with a badge and a gun
To be beatin' on, and thrown in jail
We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell
*** with me 'cause I'm a teenager
With a little bit of gold and a pager
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product
Thinkin' every *** is sellin' narcotics
You'd rather see me in the pen
Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in the Benzo
Beat a police outta shape
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape
To tape off the scene of the slaughter
Still getting swole off bread and water
I don't know if they *** or what
Search a *** down and grabbin' his nuts
And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none
But don't let it be a black and a white one
'Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top
Black police showin' out for the white cop
Ice Cube will swarm
On any *** in a blue uniform
Just 'cause I'm from the CPT, punk police are afraid of me
A young *** on a warpath
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath
Of cops, dyin' in L.A.
Yo Dre, I got somethin' to say
** the police, ** -, *** -
** the police, ** -, *** -
** the police, ** the-, *** the-
*** the police (Example of scene one)
Pull your goddamn ass over right now
Aw shit, now what the *** you pullin' me over for?
'Cause I feel like it
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the *** up
Man, *** this shit
Alright, smart-***, I'm taking your black ass to jail
MC Ren, will you please give your testimony
To the jury about this *** up incident
*** the police and Ren said it with authority
Because the niggas on the street is a majority
A gang, is with whoever I'm steppin'
And the *** ' weapon is kept in
A stash spot, for the so-called law
Wishin' Ren was a *** that they never saw
Lights start flashin' behind me
But they're scared of a *** so they mace me to blind me
But that *** don't work, I just laugh
Because it gives 'em a hint not to step in my path
For police, I'm sayin', "*** you, punk"
Readin' my rights and shit, it's all junk
Pullin' out a silly club, so you stand
With a fake-*** badge and a gun in your hand
But take off the gun so you can see what's up
And we'll go at it, punk, I'ma *** you up
Make ya think I'm a kick your ***
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast
I'm sneaky as *** when it comes to crime
But I'm a smoke 'em now, and not next time
Smoke any *** that sweats me
Or any *** that threatens me
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope
Takin' out a cop or two, they can't cope with me
The *** ' villian that's mad
With potential to get bad as fuck
So I'm a turn it around
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound
Yeah, somethin' like that, but it all depends on the size of the gat
Takin' out a police would make my day
But a ** like Ren don't give a ** to say
** the police, ** -, *** -
** the police, ** -, *** -
** the police, ** the-, *** the-
*** the police
Yeah, man, what you need?
Police, open now (Aww, shit)
We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest
Get down and put your hands right where I can see 'em!
Man, what the fuck did I do? Man, what did I do?
Just shut the fuck up and get your *** ass on the floor!
But I didn't do shit
Man, just shut the *** up!
Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand
And tell the jury how you feel about this ***?
I'm tired of the *** ' jackin'
Sweatin' my gang while I'm chillin' in the shack, and
Shining the light in my face, and for what?
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt
I kick ***, or maybe 'cause I blast
On a stupid **  ** when I'm playin' with the trigger
Of any Uzi or an AK
'Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say
They put up my picture with silence
'Cause my identity by itself causes violence
The E with the criminal behavior
Yeah, I'm a gangster, but still, I got flavor
Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got?
A *** in a uniform waitin' to get shot
By me, or another nigga.
And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smarter or bigger
(Size don't mean ***, he's from the old school, fool)
And as you all know, E's here to rule
Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin in the mirror
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a
Dumb motherfucker with a gun
And if I'm rollin' off the eight, he'll be the one
That I take out, and then get away
While I'm drivin off laughin'
This is what I'll say
** the police, ** -, *** -
** the police, ** -
** the police, ** -, *** -
*** the police (The verdict)
The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck
Whitebread, chicken ** **
Wait, that's a lie, that's a goddamn lie
Get him out of here (I want justice)
Get him the *** out my face (I want justice)
Out, right now
** you, you black **
*** the police
*** the police
*** the police
