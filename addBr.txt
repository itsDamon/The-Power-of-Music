Venite tutti, che strana meraviglia il mare ci portò,
venite tutti, è Gulliver il grande che il mare ci portò.
Addormentato davanti a noi Gulliver il grande
è una nera montagna che ci toglie il sole.
E' Gulliver il grande che il mare ci portò.
Così curioso davanti a noi
l'uomo montagna ci guarda già,
venite tutti ad ammirare
la meraviglia vista mai.
Gli uomini piccoli pensano già
che la sua forza li aiuterà,
Gulliver il grande si chiede già
in quale altro mare naufragherà.
Venite tutti, che strana meraviglia il mare ci portò,
venite tutti, è Gulliver il nano che il mare ci portò.
Di freddo trema davanti a noi Gulliver il nano
Ma i suoi occhi cercano già
i nostri volti
È Gulliver il nano che il mare ci portò.
Venite tutti ad ammirare
la meraviglia con cui giocare,
così indifeso davanti a noi
come un bambino a cui insegnare.
E mentre invece dentro di sé
del nostro aspetto lui ride già,
Gulliver il nano sognando sta
un altro mare per naufragare.

Song Commentary:
The song refers to the first two travels of "Gulliver's Travel", a satire wrote by Jonathan Swift.
In his first voyage Gulliver shipwrecked on an island inhabited by the Liliputians, a race of tiny
people. At first they are hospitable with Gulliver but when he refuses to conquer the isle of Blefuscu
for them he's charged with treason by the Liliputians. He managed to escape Liliput thanks to the
help from a courtier.
In his second voyage, Gulliver lands in Brobdingnag, an isle inhabited by giants. He is quickly
discovered by one of them that exhibits him for money. Soon he became famous and is sold to the
King.
The two talk about European politics and the king is displeased with the description of the
corruption of the old world and usage of weapons like guns and cannon. Gulliver will be soon
grabbed by a giant eagle and dropped in the sea where he will be rescued by some sailors.
Historic context:
Johnathan Swift was an english writer born in the 17th century in Dublin.
His masterpiece, "Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World. In Four Parts. By Lemuel
Gulliver, First a Surgen, and then a Captain of Several Ships" aka "Gulliver's Travels", offers a
satirical view of the European governments, an example can be found in his first voyage, the
Liliputians put great emphasis on trivial matters: even which end of a egg a person cracks becomes
a deep political rift, the comparison with European politics of the time is clear.
In the third voyage of Gulliver, Swift describes the of Lapuda, a flying island where people are
study mathematics and science but can't use them for practical terms; that's a clear critique to the
Royal Society, the scientific academy of London.
On his last travel the protagonist meet the Houyhnhnms, a race of talking horses that represents the
reason and virtue. Gulliver soon idenfies with them and doing so he loses some of his humanity in
the process, becaming misanthrope. Swift thinks that human beings are incapable of aspiring
virtuous rationality that Gulliver has glimpsed.
