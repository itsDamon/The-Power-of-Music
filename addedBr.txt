['Pac talking]<br>
Big Syke, Newt, Hank<br>
Beugard, Big Sur (yeah)<br>
Y'all know how this shit go (y'know)<br>
{All Eyez On Me}<br>
Motherfuckin O.G.<br>
Roll up in the club and shit (is that right?)<br>
{All Eyez On Me}<br>
{All Eyez On Me}<br>
But you know what?<br>
<br>
[2Pac]<br>
I bet you got it twisted you don't know who to trust<br>
So many playa hating niggaz tryin to sound like us<br>
Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowin<br>
Straight to the depths of hell is where those cowards goin<br>
Well are you still down nigga? Holla when you see me<br>
And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me<br>
I got a caravan of niggaz every time we ride (every time we ride)<br>
Hittin motherfuckers up when we pass by (when we pass by)<br>
Until I die; live the life of a boss playa<br>
Cause even when I'm high, fuck with me and get crossed later<br>
The futures in my eyes, cause all I want is cash and thangs<br>
A five-double-oh - Benz flauntin flashy rings, uhh<br>
Bitches pursue me like a dream<br>
Been know to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend<br>
It seems - my main thang was to be major paid<br>
The game sharper than a motherfuckin razor blade<br>
Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies<br>
One nigga's gettin jealous, and motherfuckers died<br>
Depend on me like the first and fifteenth<br>
They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me<br>
We got foe niggaz, and lowriders, in ski masks<br>
screamin Thug Life every time they pass {All Eyez On Me}<br>
<br>
[Chorus One: 2Pac]<br>
<br>
Live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die<br>
live the life of a boss playa {All Eyez On Me}<br>
cause even gettin high.. ..{All Eyez On Me}<br>
Live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die<br>
live the life of a boss playa, cause even gettin high..<br>
<br>
[Syke]<br>
Heeyyy, to my nigga 'Pac..<br>
So much trouble in the world, nigga<br>
Can't nobody feel your pain<br>
The world's changin everyday, times moving faaast<br>
My girl said I need a raise, how long will she last?<br>
I'm caught between my woman, and my pistol, and my chips<br>
Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as I dip<br>
I'm lost in the land with no plan, livin life flawless<br>
Crime boss, contraband, let me toss this<br>
Needy hookers got a lot of nerve, let my bucket swerve<br>
I'm takin off from the curb<br>
The nervousness neglect make me pack a tec<br>
Devoted to servin this, Moet and paaayyy-checks<br>
Like Akai satellite nigga I'm forever ballin<br>
It ain't right parasites triggers and fleas crawlin<br>
Sucker duck and get busted, no emotion<br>
My devotion is handlin my business nigga keep on coastin<br>
Where you goin I been there came back as lonely homie<br>
Steady flowin against the grain niggaz STILL don't know me<br>
It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit<br>
It ain't funny niggaz don't even know how to act - shit!<br>
What can I do, what can I say, is there another way?<br>
Blunts and gin all day, twenty-fo' parlay<br>
My little homie G, can't you see, I'm busta free<br>
Niggaz can't stand me - all eyes on me!<br>
<br>
[Chorus Two: 2Pac]<br>
<br>
I live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die<br>
Live the life as a boss playa {All Eyez On Me}<br>
cause even gettin high {All Eyez On Me}<br>
I live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die<br>
live the life as a boss playa {All Eyez On Me}<br>
cause even gettin high<br>
<br>
[2Pac]<br>
The feds is watchin, niggaz plottin to get me<br>
Will I survive, will I die? Come on let's picture the possibility<br>
Givin me charges, lawyers makin a grip<br>
I told the judge I was raised wrong, and that's why I blaze shit<br>
Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager<br>
On my mobile callin big shots on the scene major<br>
Packing hundreds in my drawers; fuck the law<br>
Bitches I fuck with a passion, I'm livin rough and raw<br>
Catchin cases at a fast rate, ballin in the fast lane<br>
Hustle til the mornin, never stopped until the cash came<br>
Live my life as a thug nigga, until the day I die<br>
Live my life as a boss playa, cause even gettin high<br>
these niggaz got me tossin shit<br>
I put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit<br>
Keep your head up nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer<br>
Up in the Benz burnin rubber<br>
The money is mandatory, the hoes is fully strapped<br>
This criminal lifestyle, equipped with the bulletproof vest<br>
Make sure your eyes is on the meal ticket<br>
Get your money motherfucker let's get rich and we'll kick it<br>
All eyes on me!<br>
<br>
[Chorus Three: 2Pac]<br>
<br>
I live the life as a thug nigga, until the day I die<br>
Live the life as a boss playa {All Eyez On Me}<br>
cause even gettin high.. ..{All Eyez On Me}<br>
I live the life as a thug nigga, until the day I die<br>
Live the life as a boss playa {All Eyez On Me}<br>
