Venite tutti, che strana meraviglia il mare ci portò,<br>
venite tutti, è Gulliver il grande che il mare ci portò.<br>
Addormentato davanti a noi Gulliver il grande<br>
è una nera montagna che ci toglie il sole.<br>
E' Gulliver il grande che il mare ci portò.<br>
Così curioso davanti a noi<br>
l'uomo montagna ci guarda già,<br>
venite tutti ad ammirare<br>
la meraviglia vista mai.<br>
Gli uomini piccoli pensano già<br>
che la sua forza li aiuterà,<br>
Gulliver il grande si chiede già<br>
in quale altro mare naufragherà.<br>
Venite tutti, che strana meraviglia il mare ci portò,<br>
venite tutti, è Gulliver il nano che il mare ci portò.<br>
Di freddo trema davanti a noi Gulliver il nano<br>
Ma i suoi occhi cercano già<br>
i nostri volti<br>
È Gulliver il nano che il mare ci portò.<br>
Venite tutti ad ammirare<br>
la meraviglia con cui giocare,<br>
così indifeso davanti a noi<br>
come un bambino a cui insegnare.<br>
E mentre invece dentro di sé<br>
del nostro aspetto lui ride già,<br>
Gulliver il nano sognando sta<br>
un altro mare per naufragare.<br>

Song Commentary:<br>
The song refers to the first two travels of "Gulliver's Travel", a satire wrote by Jonathan Swift.<br>
In his first voyage Gulliver shipwrecked on an island inhabited by the Liliputians, a race of tiny<br>
people. At first they are hospitable with Gulliver but when he refuses to conquer the isle of Blefuscu<br>
for them he's charged with treason by the Liliputians. He managed to escape Liliput thanks to the<br>
help from a courtier.<br>
In his second voyage, Gulliver lands in Brobdingnag, an isle inhabited by giants. He is quickly<br>
discovered by one of them that exhibits him for money. Soon he became famous and is sold to the<br>
King.<br>
The two talk about European politics and the king is displeased with the description of the<br>
corruption of the old world and usage of weapons like guns and cannon. Gulliver will be soon<br>
grabbed by a giant eagle and dropped in the sea where he will be rescued by some sailors.<br>
Historic context:<br>
Johnathan Swift was an english writer born in the 17th century in Dublin.<br>
His masterpiece, "Travels into Several Remote Nations of the World. In Four Parts. By Lemuel<br>
Gulliver, First a Surgen, and then a Captain of Several Ships" aka "Gulliver's Travels", offers a<br>
satirical view of the European governments, an example can be found in his first voyage, the<br>
Liliputians put great emphasis on trivial matters: even which end of a egg a person cracks becomes<br>
a deep political rift, the comparison with European politics of the time is clear.<br>
In the third voyage of Gulliver, Swift describes the of Lapuda, a flying island where people are<br>
study mathematics and science but can't use them for practical terms; that's a clear critique to the<br>
Royal Society, the scientific academy of London.<br>
On his last travel the protagonist meet the Houyhnhnms, a race of talking horses that represents the<br>
reason and virtue. Gulliver soon idenfies with them and doing so he loses some of his humanity in<br>
the process, becaming misanthrope. Swift thinks that human beings are incapable of aspiring<br>
virtuous rationality that Gulliver has glimpsed.<br>
