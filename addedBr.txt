The Tale of Cu Chulainn<br>
<br>
In the sodden snow of the Irish hills<br>
Was born a Tuatha's child<br>
With a fighting heart and immortal skill<br>
And a spirit fiery and wild<br>
<br>
Through a prophecy he was bound and doomed<br>
To a short and a glorious life<br>
And he bore the name Setanta till<br>
A famous fateful night<br>
<br>
With his hurley in his hands<br>
His name would cross the land<br>
<br>
Well his Uncle Connor who wore the crown<br>
Of Ulster on his head<br>
In the home of Culainn the smith sat down<br>
For mead and mutton and bread<br>
<br>
At the door lay the Cú, the faithful hound<br>
A huge and and terrible beast<br>
When a thief or enemy trod his ground<br>
Their bones became his feast<br>
<br>
Well Setanta joined them late at night<br>
And the hound it leapt to shred<br>
But he raised his hurley, pucked the ball<br>
Right through the poor beast's head<br>
<br>
He spoke remorse as the smith he cried<br>
For his lost and murdered hound<br>
'I will be your Cú now from this night<br>
Till another you have found'<br>
<br>
So he lay outside the door<br>
One eye watching on the moors<br>
<br>
And the name Cú Chulainn<br>
Was sung out loud that night<br>
In a tale of rage and ruin and of might<br>
And the name Cú Chulainn<br>
So furious and wild<br>
To remain in myth and memory<br>
A legend of the isle<br>

<br>
He trained on the Isle of Sky and Shadow<br>
Bore an abandoned son<br>
And met his battle brother Ferdiad<br>
Many a tale they spun<br>
<br>
Well he fought with the strength of many men<br>
A beast who bloodied the fields<br>
In a bloodlust battle frenzy<br>
His skin would shift and peel<br>
<br>
His son would find him as man<br>
But would not tell his name<br>
So he took a spear to his own child<br>
And doomed himself to shame<br>
<br>
When the canny Queen Méabh attacked his land<br>
To steal the bull of brown<br>
She sent out Ferdiad to fight<br>
Cú Chualainn struck him down<br>
<br>
Blood of son and brother fell<br>
He wailed and cried farewell<br>
<br>
And the name Cú Chulainn<br>
Was sung out loud that night<br>
In a tale of rage and ruin and of might<br>
And the name Cú Chulainn<br>
So furious and wild<br>

When the father of fair Emer<br>
Refused to give her to wed<br>
Cú Chulainn tore his castle down<br>
And left the whole place dead<br>
<br>
They loved eachother, man and wife<br>
Despite his many affairs<br>
Then he met the Morrigan, turned her down<br>
And earned her vengeful glare<br>
<br>
She weakened him and broke his strength<br>
With trickery and lies<br>
By feeding him the flesh of dogs<br>
Three crones were her disguise<br>
<br>
The Queen and Lugaid saw their chance<br>
To fight the Cú and win<br>
When he battled next 3 spears were thrown<br>
And one tore through his skin<br>
<br>
So he tied himself to a mighty stone<br>
By his guts and belt he hung<br>
And so he still stood on his feet<br>
Till the last breath it left his lungs<br>
<br>
And a light shone out so grand<br>
Till the raven came to land<br>
<br>
And the name Cú Chulainn<br>
Was sung out loud that night<br>
In a tale of rage and ruin and of might<br>
And the name Cú Chulainn<br>
So furious and wild<br>
To remain in myth and memory<br>

MEANING<br>
The song tells the legend of the Celtic warrior hero of Irish mythology.<br>
The song tells of his birth in the hills of Ireland, his upbringing and training on the Isle of Sky and Shadow, his exploits including challenges with his Uncle Connor,<br>
defeating the monstrous hound of Culainn, and defending Ulster from the Queen Méabh, his brief but intense romance with Emer, and ultimately his death by the hand of Lugaid.<br>
Despite his shortened life, Cú Chulainn is remembered for his courage and legendary skill, to this day. The song wants to pay tribute to this iconic Celtic hero<br>
and celebrate the legend of Cú Chulainn as a timeless reminder of courage, strength, and honour.<br>
RIMANDO LETTERARIO:<br>
Cú Chulainn, called the Hound of Ulster, is a warrior hero and demigod in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology,<br>
as well as in Scottish and Manx folklore. He is believed to be an incarnation of the Irish god Lugh, who is also his father.<br>
His mother is the mortal Deichtine, sister of king Conchobar mac Nessa.<br>
<br>
Born Sétanta, he gained his better-known name as a child, after killing Culann's fierce guard dog in self defence<br>
and offering to take its place until a replacement could be raised, so he became the "Hound (cú) of Culann".<br>
He was trained in martial arts by Scáthach, who gave him the spear Gáe Bulg. It was prophesied that his great feats would give him everlasting fame,<br>
but that his life would be short. At the age of seventeen he defended Ulster single-handedly against the armies of queen Medb of Connacht in the famous Táin Bó Cúailnge<br>
("Cattle Raid of Cooley"). He is known for his terrifying battle frenzy (ríastrad), in which he becomes an unrecognisable monster who knows neither friend or enemy.<br>
He fights from his chariot, driven by his loyal charioteer Láeg and drawn by his horses, Liath Macha and Dub Sainglend.<br>
<br>
Cú Chulainn's wife is Emer, although he has many other lovers.<br>
With Aífe he has a son named Connla, whom Cú Chulainn tragically kills. Cú Chulainn himself is said to have died in battle,<br>
binding himself to a standing stone so he can die on his feet. He later became an icon for Irish nationalists.<br>
