Revolution in their minds, the children start to march<br>
Against the world in which they have to live<br>
And all the hate that's in their hearts<br>
They're tired of being pushed around<br>
And told just what to do<br>
They'll fight the world until they've won<br>
And love comes flowing through, yeah<br>
Children of tomorrow live in the tears that fall today<br>
Will the sun rise up tomorrow bring in peace in any way?<br>
Must the world live in the shadow of atomic fear?<br>
Can they win the fight for peace or will they disappear? Yeah<br>
So, you children of the world<br>
Listen to what I say<br>
If you want a better place to live in<br>
Spread the word today<br>
Show the world that love is still alive, you must be brave<br>
Or you children of today are children of the grave, yeah<br>
