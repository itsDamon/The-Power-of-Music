The song "Guerrilla Radio" by Rage Against the Machine is about the struggle of the oppressed in society and their struggle to make<br>
their voice heard against the oppressors. The text implies a revolution of the silent masses,<br>
and that the only way to make your voice heard is through a "guerrilla radio", or unconventional methods of communication.<br>
In the song, the speaker encourages the listener to join their cause and use music and communication<br>
as a means to free himself from the constraints of the "brutal farce". The song also serves as a call to arms,<br>
urging the people to fight for what is right and establish an environment of equality.<br>
The House adopted a non-binding resolution on the situation in the Middle East.<br>
Finally, the song sends a message of hope, insisting that with the right tools and push, a revolution is possible and that "all hell cannot stop us now".<br>

rage against the machine - guerrilla radio<br>
<br>
Transmission third world war third round<br>
A decade of the weapon of sound above ground<br>
No shelter if you're lookin' for shade<br>
I lick shots at the brutal charade<br>
As the polls close like a casket<br>
On truth devoured<br>
A Silent play in the shadow of power<br>
A spectacle monopolized<br>
The camera's eyes on choice disguised<br>
Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?<br>
Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?<br>
Yes a spectacle monopolized<br>
They hold the reins and stole your eyes<br>
Or the fistagons<br>
The bullets and bombs<br>
Who stuff the banks<br>
Who staff the party ranks<br>
More for Gore or the son of a drug lord<br>
None of the above fuck it cut the cord<br>
Lights out<br>
Guerrilla Radio, turn that shit up<br>
Lights out<br>
Guerrilla Radio, turn that shit up<br>
Lights out<br>
Guerrilla Radio, turn that shit up<br>
Lights out<br>
Guerrilla Radio<br>
Contact I highjacked the frequencies<br>
Blockin' the beltway<br>
Move on D.C.<br>
Way past the days of Bombin' M.C.'s<br>
Sound off Mumia gwan be free<br>
Who gottem yo check the federal file<br>
All you pen devils know the trial was vile<br>
An army of pigs try to silence my style<br>
Off 'em all out that box<br>
It's my radio dial<br>
Lights out<br>
Guerrilla Radio, turn that shit up<br>
Lights out<br>
Guerrilla Radio, turn that shit up<br>
Lights out<br>
Guerrilla Radio, turn that shit up<br>
Lights out<br>
Guerrilla Radio, turn that shit up<br>
It has to start somewhere, it has to start sometime<br>
What better place than here, what better time than now?<br>
All hell can't stop us now<br>
All hell can't stop us now<br>
All hell can't stop us now<br>
All hell can't stop us now<br>
All hell can't stop us now<br>
All hell can't stop us now<br>
