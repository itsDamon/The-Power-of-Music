Right about now NWA court is in full effect<br>
Judge Dre presiding in the case of NWA versus the police department.<br>
Prosecuting attourneys are MC Ren, Ice Cube and Eazy ***â€™ E<br>
Order, order, order, Ice Cube take the ***' stand<br>
Do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth<br>
And nothin' but the truth so help your black ***?<br>
You goddamn right<br>
Well, won't you tell everybody what the *** you gotta say?<br>
*** the police comin' straight from the underground<br>
A Young *** got it bad 'cause I'm brown<br>
And not the other color so police think<br>
They have the authority to kill a minority<br>
*** that shit, 'cause I ain't the one<br>
For a punk ***  with a badge and a gun<br>
To be beatin' on, and thrown in jail<br>
We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell<br>
*** with me 'cause I'm a teenager<br>
With a little bit of gold and a pager<br>
Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product<br>
Thinkin' every *** is sellin' narcotics<br>
You'd rather see me in the pen<br>
Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in the Benzo<br>
Beat a police outta shape<br>
And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape<br>
To tape off the scene of the slaughter<br>
Still getting swole off bread and water<br>
I don't know if they *** or what<br>
Search a *** down and grabbin' his nuts<br>
And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none<br>
But don't let it be a black and a white one<br>
'Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top<br>
Black police showin' out for the white cop<br>
Ice Cube will swarm<br>
On any *** in a blue uniform<br>
Just 'cause I'm from the CPT, punk police are afraid of me<br>
A young *** on a warpath<br>
And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath<br>
Of cops, dyin' in L.A.<br>
Yo Dre, I got somethin' to say<br>
** the police, ** -, *** -<br>
** the police, ** -, *** -<br>
** the police, ** the-, *** the-<br>
*** the police (Example of scene one)<br>
Pull your goddamn ass over right now<br>
Aw shit, now what the *** you pullin' me over for?<br>
'Cause I feel like it<br>
Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the *** up<br>
Man, *** this shit<br>
Alright, smart-***, I'm taking your black ass to jail<br>
MC Ren, will you please give your testimony<br>
To the jury about this *** up incident<br>
*** the police and Ren said it with authority<br>
Because the niggas on the street is a majority<br>
A gang, is with whoever I'm steppin'<br>
And the *** ' weapon is kept in<br>
A stash spot, for the so-called law<br>
Wishin' Ren was a *** that they never saw<br>
Lights start flashin' behind me<br>
But they're scared of a *** so they mace me to blind me<br>
But that *** don't work, I just laugh<br>
Because it gives 'em a hint not to step in my path<br>
For police, I'm sayin', "*** you, punk"<br>
Readin' my rights and shit, it's all junk<br>
Pullin' out a silly club, so you stand<br>
With a fake-*** badge and a gun in your hand<br>
But take off the gun so you can see what's up<br>
And we'll go at it, punk, I'ma *** you up<br>
Make ya think I'm a kick your ***<br>
But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast<br>
I'm sneaky as *** when it comes to crime<br>
But I'm a smoke 'em now, and not next time<br>
Smoke any *** that sweats me<br>
Or any *** that threatens me<br>
I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope<br>
Takin' out a cop or two, they can't cope with me<br>
The *** ' villian that's mad<br>
With potential to get bad as fuck<br>
So I'm a turn it around<br>
Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound<br>
Yeah, somethin' like that, but it all depends on the size of the gat<br>
Takin' out a police would make my day<br>
But a ** like Ren don't give a ** to say<br>
** the police, ** -, *** -<br>
** the police, ** -, *** -<br>
** the police, ** the-, *** the-<br>
*** the police<br>
Yeah, man, what you need?<br>
Police, open now (Aww, shit)<br>
We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest<br>
Get down and put your hands right where I can see 'em!<br>
Man, what the fuck did I do? Man, what did I do?<br>
Just shut the fuck up and get your *** ass on the floor!<br>
But I didn't do shit<br>
Man, just shut the *** up!<br>
Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand<br>
And tell the jury how you feel about this ***?<br>
I'm tired of the *** ' jackin'<br>
Sweatin' my gang while I'm chillin' in the shack, and<br>
Shining the light in my face, and for what?<br>
Maybe it's because I kick so much butt<br>
I kick ***, or maybe 'cause I blast<br>
On a stupid **  ** when I'm playin' with the trigger<br>
Of any Uzi or an AK<br>
'Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say<br>
They put up my picture with silence<br>
'Cause my identity by itself causes violence<br>
The E with the criminal behavior<br>
Yeah, I'm a gangster, but still, I got flavor<br>
Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got?<br>
A *** in a uniform waitin' to get shot<br>
By me, or another nigga.<br>
And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smarter or bigger<br>
(Size don't mean ***, he's from the old school, fool)<br>
And as you all know, E's here to rule<br>
Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin in the mirror<br>
And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a<br>
Dumb motherfucker with a gun<br>
And if I'm rollin' off the eight, he'll be the one<br>
That I take out, and then get away<br>
While I'm drivin off laughin'<br>
This is what I'll say<br>
** the police, ** -, *** -<br>
** the police, ** -<br>
** the police, ** -, *** -<br>
*** the police (The verdict)<br>
The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck<br>
Whitebread, chicken ** **<br>
Wait, that's a lie, that's a goddamn lie<br>
Get him out of here (I want justice)<br>
Get him the *** out my face (I want justice)<br>
Out, right now<br>
** you, you black **<br>
*** the police<br>
*** the police<br>
*** the police<br>
<br>
*** counter=80<br>
