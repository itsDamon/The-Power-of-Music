ZERO(IMAGINE DRAGONS)<br>
LYRIC:<br>
I find it hard to say the things I want to say the most<br>
Find a little bit of steady as I get close<br>
Find a balance in the middle of the chaos<br>
Send me low, send me high, send me never demigod<br>
I remember walking in the cold of November<br>
Hoping that I make it to the end of December<br>
Twenty-seven years and the end of my mind, but<br>
Holding to the thought of another time, but<br>
Looking to the ways of the ones before me<br>
Looking for the path of the young and lonely<br>
I don't want to hear about what to do<br>
I don't want to do it just to do it for you<br>
Hello, hello<br>
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero<br>
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel<br>
Like I'm empty and there's nothing really real, real<br>
I'm looking for a way out<br>
Hello, hello<br>
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero<br>
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel<br>
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real<br>
I'm looking for a way out<br>
I find it hard to tell you how I want to run away<br>
I understand it always makes you feel a certain way<br>
I find a balance in the middle of the chaos<br>
Send me up, send me down, semi never demigod<br>
I remember walking in the heat of the summer<br>
Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder<br>
Twenty-seven years and I've nothing to show<br>
Falling from the doves to the dark of the crow<br>
Looking to the ways of the ones before me<br>
Looking for the path of the young and lonely<br>
I don't want to hear about what to do, no<br>
I don't want to do it just to do it for you<br>
Hello, hello<br>
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero<br>
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel<br>
Like I'm empty and there's nothing really real, real<br>
I'm looking for a way out<br>
Hello, hello<br>
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero<br>
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel<br>
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real<br>
I'm looking for a way out<br>
Let me tell you 'bout it<br>
Well let me tell you 'bout it<br>
Maybe you're the same as me<br>
Let me tell you 'bout it<br>
Well let me tell you 'bout it<br>
They say the truth will set you free<br>
Hello, hello<br>
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero<br>
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel<br>
Like I'm empty and there's nothing really real, real<br>
I'm looking for a way out<br>
Hello, hello<br>
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero<br>
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel<br>
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real<br>
I'm looking for a way out<br>

SONG COMMENTARY<br>
in this song by imagine dragons, called zero.  Talk about identity and loneliness.<br>
The meaning of the song is in the self-acceptance.<br>
as the singer says, there are two problems that are part of this generation of the internet.<br>
He talks about a serious problem, but in the song he expresses it in a very funny way, using simple and playful images.<br>
In this song he wants to express the sense of not being understood, which refers to a sense of sadness.<br>
in the official video of the song he expresses it using a gaming environment, like going to the cinema, but still feeling alone.<br>
SOCIAL THEMES REFERRING TO THE SONG<br>
loneliness and depression are very common problems in this society, often we don't talk about them we try to hide these emotions.  Sometimes these conditions become very serious, that you can no longer bear the weight and end up hurting yourself.<br>
It can also have a negative impact on mental health leading to a risk of anxiety, low self-esteem, sleep problems and stress.<br>
It can affect individuals of any age, even the elderly.<br>
this choice can take place by personal choice, by personal events or things that have happened in life, some people despite their loneliness manage to be happy.<br>
Loneliness can be caused by various factors, such as:<br>
Lack of meaningful social relationships: If a person doesn't have enough social contacts or has no meaningful relationships in their life, they may feel lonely.<br>
Separation or Loss of a Loved One: The loss of a loved one, through death or separation, can lead to feelings of loneliness and sadness.<br>
Relocation or change of environment: Moving to a new place or environment can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, especially if the person has not yet established new relationships.<br>
Mental health issues: Certain mental health conditions, such as depression or anxiety, can lead to feelings of loneliness.<br>
Physical health issues: Illness or injury that limits daily activities or social participation can lead to loneliness.<br>
Another important factor mentioned in the song is identity, that is the perception that each individual has of himself, but also of his own awareness of existing, for example family, friends, nationality.<br>
identity arises from an important question: "who am I?"  and above all "who am I in relation to others?"  and "who are the others in relation to me?".<br>
Identity is very important because it is a constitutive trait of our personality that allows us to define ourselves, to present ourselves to the world and to make ourselves recognizable, therefore it is the mutual recognition between society and the individual<br>
