            The song can be defined as an anthem of protest towards the school
            system, which was expressed through the complaints of children against
            a rigid education, capable of brainwashing the pupils. "We don’t need
            no education / We don’t need no thought control". The song can also be
            protest against the homogenisation of people in the society, without a
            difference from the people and this is the reason of the wall , it
            divide the people

        This song talks about so many topic like drugs,education life of a teenager who lost his dad in war called Pink.
        Every theme of this song is matched with a part of life of a human : the childhood, the adolescence and the adult age.
        The first part of this song tell the backstory of Pink , a future rockstar , who had to live without his father because
        he died in war; Pink question himself what the father left to him and I think this is a brilliant question.
        The education topic is explained  in this part and talk about the school system, it oppresses every student because the teacher
        don't enhance the students because he wants a flat class like a wall.
        The topic of the drugs and loneliness  is explaining in the third part of this song, pink understands that he needs no one around him and choose drugs to trying to escape from reality because now
        Pink is a rockstar and he can't handle his fame. This story is inspired by the true story of Syd Barrett who has a life like Pink's one
        and left the band in 1974.
