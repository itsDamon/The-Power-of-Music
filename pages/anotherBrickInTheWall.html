        <div class="actualDescription contents">
            The first part talks about the beginning of the construction of the wall and
            how every bad experience add a brick to the wall, one of this is the
            death of father.
            The second part tell us the education of Pink that have to follow
            every teacher order and this makes the wall around Pink higher.
            This part can be defined as an anthem of protest towards the school
            system, which was expressed through the complaints of children against
            a rigid education, capable of brainwashing the pupils. "We don’t need
            no education / We don’t need no thought control". The song can also be
            protest against the homogenisation of people in the society, without a
            difference from the people and this is the reason of the wall , it
            divides the people.
            This third part is the last brick, the awareness of wanting to isolate himself,
            now the wall is complete and Pink realises he can't escape anymore, he has to accept
            his new life with every brick that build the wall.
            This song close with this words : "All in all you were all just bricks in the wall"

        This song talks about so many topic like drugs,school and childhood without father, each theme is matched with a part of a person's life,
        the childhood,the adolescence and the adult age;
        The first part tell about the  Pink's backstory, he lost his father in war and he question himself what the father leave to him,
        I think this question is brilliant because I question to myself the same question when I lost my father more than 1 year ago.
        The theme of education is explained in the second part of this song, the school repress the student and make
        his mind flat like a wall.
        School makes the students empty and without a personal opinion cause their opinion is the teacher's one.
        The topic of the drugs and loneliness is explain in the third part of this song, it's explain like a method to escape from reality
        that oppresses Pink's mind because he can't handle his fame and choose to stay alone, the song said "I don’t need no arms around me".
        This story is inspired by the true story of the singer Syd Barret
        one of the first member of Pink Floyd who left the band in 1974 because the drugs took him away.
