          Come you masters of war<br />
          You that build the big guns<br />
          You that build the death planes<br />
          You that build all the bombs<br />
          You that hide behind walls<br />
          You that hide behind desks<br />
          I just want you to know<br />
          I can see through your masks<br />
          You that never done nothin'<br />
          But build to destroy<br />
          You play with my world<br />
          Like it's your little toy<br />
          You put a gun in my hand<br />
          And you hide from my eyes<br />
          And you turn and run farther<br />
          When the fast bullets fly<br />
          Like Judas of old<br />
          You lie and deceive<br />
          A world war can be won<br />
          You want me to believe<br />
          But I see through your eyes<br />
          And I see through your brain<br />
          Like I see through the water<br />
          That runs down my drain<br />
          You fasten all the triggers<br />
          For the others to fire<br />
          Then you sit back and watch<br />
          When the death count gets higher<br />
          You hide in your mansion<br />
          While the young people's blood<br />
          Flows out of their bodies<br />
          And is buried in the mud<br />
          You've thrown the worst fear<br />
          That can ever be hurled<br />
          Fear to bring children<br />
          Into the world<br />
          For threatening my baby<br />
          Unborn and unnamed<br />
          You ain't worth the blood<br />
          That runs in your veins<br />
          How much do I know<br />
          To talk out of turn<br />
          You might say that I'm young<br />
          You might say I'm unlearned<br />
          But there's one thing I know<br />
          Though I'm younger than you<br />
          That even Jesus would never<br />
          Forgive what you do<br />
          Let me ask you one question<br />
          Is your money that good?<br />
          Will it buy you forgiveness<br />
          Do you think that it could?<br />
          I think you will find<br />
          When your death takes its toll<br />
          All the money you made<br />
          Will never buy back your soul<br />
          And I hope that you die<br />
          And your death will come soon<br />
          I'll follow your casket<br />
          By the pale afternoon<br />
          And I'll watch while you're lowered<br />
          Down to your deathbed<br />
          And I'll stand over your grave<br />
          'Til I'm sure that you're dead<br />

          Masters of War" is a protest song written by Bob Dylan in the early
          1960s. The song is a criticism of the military-industrial complex, and
          it portrays war as an immoral and destructive force that benefits only
          those who profit from it. The lyrics of the song are powerful and
          direct, with Dylan using strong language to condemn the actions of
          those who make war: "Come you masters of war You that build all the
          guns You that build the death planes You that build the big bombs You
          that hide behind walls You that hide behind desks I just want you to
          know I can see through your masks" The song goes on to criticize those
          who profit from war, and those who send young men to fight and die for
          their own gain: "You've thrown the worst fear That can ever be hurled
          Fear to bring children Into the world For threatening my baby Unborn
          and unnamed You ain't worth the blood That runs in your veins"
          "Masters of War" has been covered by many artists over the years and
          has become a classic anti-war song. Its message continues to resonate
          with audiences today as conflicts continue around the world.
