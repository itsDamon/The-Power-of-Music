          America, hahaha, we love you<br />
          How many people are proud to be citizens<br />
          Of this beautiful country of ours, the stripes and the stars<br />
          For the rights that men have died for to protect?<br />
          The women and men who have broke their necks<br />
          For the freedom of speech<br />
          The United States government has sworn to uphold<br />
          (Yo, I want everybody to listen to the words of this song)<br />
          Or so we're told<br />
          I never would've dreamed in a million years I'd see<br />
          So many motherfuckin' people who feel like me<br />
          Who share the same views and the same exact beliefs<br />
          It's like a fucking army marching in back of me<br />
          So many lives I touched, so much anger aimed<br />
          In no particular direction, just sprays and sprays<br />
          And straight through your radio waves, it plays and plays<br />
          'Til it stays stuck in your head, for days and days<br />
          Who would've thought, standing in this mirror, bleaching my hair<br />
          With some peroxide, reaching for a t-shirt to wear<br />
          That I would catapult to the forefront of rap like this?<br />
          How could I predict my words would have an impact like this?<br />
          I must've struck a chord with somebody up in the office<br />
          'Cause Congress keep telling me I ain't causing nothin' but
          problems<br />
          And now they're saying I'm in trouble with the government<br />
          I'm loving it, I shoveled shit all my life, and now I'm dumping it
          on<br />
          White America, I could be one of your kids<br />
          White America, little Eric looks just like this<br />
          White America, Erica loves my shit<br />
          I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get<br />
          White America, I could be one of your kids<br />
          White America, little Eric looks just like this<br />
          White America, Erica loves my shit<br />
          I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get<br />
          Look at these eyes, baby blue, baby just like yourself<br />
          If they were brown, Shady'd lose, Shady sits on the shelf<br />
          But Shady's cute, Shady knew Shady's dimples would help<br />
          Make ladies swoon, baby (ooh, baby)<br />
          Look at my sales<br />
          Let's do the math, if I was black, I woulda sold half<br />
          I ain't have to graduate from Lincoln High School to know that<br />
          But I could rap, so fuck school, I'm too cool to go back<br />
          Give me the mic, show me where the fucking studio's at<br />
          When I was underground no one gave a fuck I was white<br />
          No labels wanted to sign me, almost gave up, I was like<br />
          "Fuck it, " until I met Dre, the only one to look past<br />
          Gave me a chance and I lit a fire up under his ass<br />
          Helped him get back to the top, every fan black that I got<br />
          Was probably his in exchange for every white fan that he's got<br />
          Like damn, we just swapped, sitting back looking at shit, wow<br />
          I'm like my skin is it starting to work to my benefit now? it's-<br />
          White America, I could be one of your kids<br />
          White America, little Eric looks just like this<br />
          White America, Erica loves my shit<br />
          I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get<br />
          White America, I could be one of your kids<br />
          White America, little Eric looks just like this<br />
          White America, Erica loves my shit<br />
          I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get!<br />
          See, the problem is I speak to suburban kids<br />
          Who otherwise woulda never knew these words exist<br />
          Whose moms probably woulda never gave two squirts of piss<br />
          'Til I created so much motherfucking turbulence<br />
          Straight out the tube, right into your living rooms I came<br />
          And kids flipped when they knew I was produced by Dre<br />
          That's all it took, and they were instantly hooked right in<br />
          And they connected with me too, because I looked like them<br />
          That's why they put my lyrics up under this microscope<br />
          Searching with a fine tooth comb, it's like this rope<br />
          Waiting to choke, tightening around my throat<br />
          Watching me while I write this, like, "I don't like this note"<br />
          All I hear is, lyrics, lyrics, constant controversy<br />
          Sponsors working round the clock to try to stop my concerts early<br />
          Surely hip-hop was never a problem in Harlem, only in Boston<br />
          After it bothered the fathers of daughters starting to blossom<br />
          So now I'm catching the flak from these activists when they ragging<br />
          Actin' like I'm the first rapper to smack a bitch or say "faggot, "
          shit<br />
          Just look at me like I'm your closest pal<br />
          The posterchild, the motherfucking spokesman now, for-<br />
          White America, I could be one of your kids<br />
          White America, little Eric looks just like this<br />
          White America, Erica loves my shit<br />
          I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get<br />
          White America, I could be one of your kids<br />
          White America, little Eric looks just like this<br />
          White America, Erica loves my shit<br />
          I go to TRL, look how many hugs I get<br />
          So to the parents of America, I am the Derringer<br />
          Aimed at little Erica to attack her character<br />
          The ringleader of this circus of worthless pawns<br />
          Sent to lead the march right up to the steps of Congress<br />
          And piss on the lawns of the White House<br />
          To burn the - and replace it with a Parental Advisory sticker<br />
          To spit liquor in the faces of this democracy of hypocrisy<br />
          Fuck you, Ms. Cheney<br />
          Fuck you, Tipper Gore<br />
          Fuck you with the freest of speech<br />
          This Divided States of Embarrassment will allow me to have<br />
          Fuck you<br />
          Hahaha, I'm just playing, America<br />
          You know I love you<br />

        <div class="actualDescription contents">
          This song, although not one of the rapper's most famous, has aroused
          many criticisms: the lyrics describe not only the hypocrisy that hides
          behind the apparent perfect democracy and freedom of speech of the
          United States, which are ironically ridiculed during the song by the
          author, which also happens in the music video, where Uncle Sam is
          first shown on a propaganda poster which reads "I'll kill you" while
          showing the middle finger. Subsequently, in the final part of the
          video, the same is depicted with his usual patriotic attire as a pig
          supported by wires holding a press conference while behind him, we can
          see the White House covered in money and the explosion of an atomic
          bomb. The song also describes how Eminem was regarded before and after
          he became famous: he explains that before he became a star, no record
          company wanted to sign him to a contract, and that nobody cared about
          the colour of his skin (something for which he has been criticized
          quite aggressively over the years, even by rapper Benzino, who has
          stated that "if Eminem hadn't been born white, he would never have
          sold so many records". While the song may have some racial content,
          Marshall Mathers does nothing but joke about the colour of his skin
          and his blue eyes, the fact that young people consider him as a model
          to follow, a "guru" to be taken as an example, but above all he
          highlights the fact that being white , the union (and certainly not
          the division) between the two ethnic groups, the white and the black,
          which he tries to convey through music, are always misunderstood and
          interpreted with negative tones even by the whites themselves (there
          is also a reference in the video, where, in the initial part, various
          posters of Eminem are shown next to the garbage, a symbol of the
          hatred that some have towards his way of expressing himself,
          especially the categories of parents and politicians).
