          The song expresses opposition to the leadership of White Russian
          general Alexander Kolchak, who is trying to establish a separatist
          government in Siberia.<br />
          In the song, "Apple" is a metaphor for Kolchak's power. The first
          verse tells how members of the Siberian Socialist Revolutionary Party
          (SR) praise Kolchak's authority,<br />
          but then the song goes on to criticise Kolchak as an unjust authority
          that people are tired of putting up with.<br />
          The song also expresses that the social revolution is underway and the
          power of the Soviet regime is strong.<br />
          The song also mentions the presence of the Red Army and partisans
          fighting Kolchak's army. The final section celebrates the fall of
          Kolchak and the victory of the revolution.<br />
          Overall, the song expressed enthusiasm for the Bolshevik revolution
          and opposition to the white counter-revolution represented by
          Kolchak.<br />

        The Russian Civil War was a multi year civil war appen Russia between
        1918 and 1922.<br />
        The war was fought between the Bolshevik Red Army and various opposing
        forces, the White Army, which was composed of anti-Bolshevik forces,<br />
        the international forces from both allies and central power obviously
        against the red rebels,<br />
        and independence groups many nations that were under Russian rule (such
        as Poland, Estonia, Finland, Lithuania, Azerbaijan...)<br />
        used this occasion to secede from Russia some succeeding others not.<br />
        The Bolshevik side was commanded by Vladimir Il'ič Ul'janov known as
        Vladimir Il'ič Lenin.<br />
        On the other side the White Army was commanded by Aleksandr Vasil'evič
        Kolčak, a Russian naval officer and explorer<br />
        who served as the Supreme Ruler of Russia for a brief period from 1918
        to 1919. After a coup in the Siberian republic he became its
        dictator,<br />
        and as it declares his only goals was to destroy the red rebels, and it
        fails.<br />
        in 1920 Kolčak was executed and in 1922 the Union of Soviet Socialist
        Republics abbreviated in USSR was born,<br />
        which lasted until 1991, the year of its dissolution<br />
