          A lovestruck Romeo sang the streets a serenade<br />
          Laying everybody low with a love song that he made<br />
          Finds a streetlight, steps out of the shade<br />
          Says something like, "You and me, babe, how about it?"<br />
          Juliet says, "Hey, it's Romeo, you nearly gave me a heart attack"<br />
          He's underneath the window, she's singing, "Hey, la, my boyfriend's
          back<br />
          You shouldn't come around here singing up at people like that<br />
          Anyway, what you gonna do about it?"<br />
          "Juliet, the dice was loaded from the start<br />
          And I bet, and you exploded into my heart<br />
          And I forget, I forget the movie song<br />
          When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong,
          Juliet?"<br />
          Come up on different streets, they both were streets of shame<br />
          Both dirty, both mean, yes, and the dream was just the same<br />
          And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real<br />
          How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?<br />
          When you can fall for chains of silver you can fall for chains of
          gold<br />
          You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold<br />
          You promised me everything, you promised me thick and thin, yeah<br />
          Now you just say "Oh, Romeo, yeah, you know I used to have a scene
          with him"<br />
          "Juliet, when we made love, you used to cry<br />
          You said 'I love you like the stars above, I'll love you 'til I
          die'<br />
          There's a place for us, you know the movie song<br />
          When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong,
          Juliet?"<br />
          I can't do the talks like they talk on the TV<br />
          And I can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be<br />
          I can't do everything but I'll do anything for you<br />
          I can't do anything except be in love with you<br />
          And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be<br />
          All I do is keep the beat, the bad company<br />
          All I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme<br />
          Julie, I'd do the stars with you any time<br />
          "Juliet, when we made love you used to cry<br />
          You said 'I love you like the stars above, I'll love you 'til I
          die'<br />
          There's a place for us you know the movie song<br />
          When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong,
          Juliet?"<br />
          And a lovestruck Romeo, he sang the streets a serenade<br />
          Laying everybody low with a love song that he made<br />
          Find a convenient streetlight, steps out of the shade<br />
          He says something like, "You and me, babe, how about it?"<br />
          "You and me, babe, how about it?"<br />

          "Romeo and Juliet" is a popular song written by the British band Dire
          Straits. The song was released in 1981 and was featured on their album
          "Making Movies." "Romeo and Juliet" is a ballad that tells the story
          of two star-crossed lovers from Shakespeare's play of the same name.
          The song's lyrics are inspired by the classic tale of tragedy and
          forbidden love, capturing the emotion and passion of the characters.
          Mark Knopfler's distinctive fingerpicking guitar style is a signature
          feature of the song, and the melody is both haunting and beautiful.
          The song has been covered by numerous artists over the years and
          remains a classic rock staple. It is widely considered one of Dire
          Straits' most memorable and enduring tracks, and has been described as
          a modern-day equivalent of the original story. To this day, "Romeo and
          Juliet" continues to be a timeless tribute to the power of love and
          the tragedy of its loss

        Romeo and Juliet is a timeless tragedy by William Shakespeare, believed
        to have been written in the late 16th century. Set in Verona, Italy, the
        play tells the story of the ill-fated love affair between Romeo, a
        member of the Montague family, and Juliet, a member of the Capulet
        family, who are engaged in a bitter feud. Despite the hatred and
        prejudice between their families, the two teenagers fall deeply in love
        and vow to be together, no matter the cost. The play is notable for its
        exploration of themes such as love, hate, fate, and the destructive
        power of conflict. The characters of Romeo and Juliet have become iconic
        symbols of young, passionate love, and the play has been adapted and
        reinterpreted in countless ways over the centuries. The climax of the
        play sees the tragic deaths of both Romeo and Juliet, who take their own
        lives in a desperate bid to remain together. Their deaths prompt the
        feuding families to reconcile, realizing the senseless waste of life
        that their feud has caused. Romeo and Juliet is widely regarded as one
        of Shakespeare's greatest works, and its influence can be seen in
        literature, film, and popular culture around the world. Its themes and
        characters continue to resonate with audiences to this day, making it a
        perennial favorite among readers and theatergoers alike.
