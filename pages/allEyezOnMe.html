          ['Pac talking]<br />
          Big Syke, Newt, Hank<br />
          Beugard, Big Sur (yeah)<br />
          Y'all know how this shit go (y'know)<br />
          {All Eyez On Me}<br />
          Motherfuckin O.G.<br />
          Roll up in the club and shit (is that right?)<br />
          {All Eyez On Me}<br />
          {All Eyez On Me}<br />
          But you know what?<br />
          <br />
          [2Pac]<br />
          I bet you got it twisted you don't know who to trust<br />
          So many playa hating niggaz tryin to sound like us<br />
          Say they ready for the funk, but I don't think they knowin<br />
          Straight to the depths of hell is where those cowards goin<br />
          Well are you still down nigga? Holla when you see me<br />
          And let these devils be sorry for the day they finally freed me<br />
          I got a caravan of niggaz every time we ride (every time we ride)<br />
          Hittin motherfuckers up when we pass by (when we pass by)<br />
          Until I die; live the life of a boss playa<br />
          Cause even when I'm high, fuck with me and get crossed later<br />
          The futures in my eyes, cause all I want is cash and thangs<br />
          A five-double-oh - Benz flauntin flashy rings, uhh<br />
          Bitches pursue me like a dream<br />
          Been know to disappear before your eyes just like a dope fiend<br />
          It seems - my main thang was to be major paid<br />
          The game sharper than a motherfuckin razor blade<br />
          Say money bring bitches, bitches bring lies<br />
          One nigga's gettin jealous, and motherfuckers died<br />
          Depend on me like the first and fifteenth<br />
          They might hold me for a second, but these punks won't get me<br />
          We got foe niggaz, and lowriders, in ski masks<br />
          screamin Thug Life every time they pass {All Eyez On Me}<br />
          <br />
          [Chorus One: 2Pac]<br />
          <br />
          Live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die<br />
          live the life of a boss playa {All Eyez On Me}<br />
          cause even gettin high.. ..{All Eyez On Me}<br />
          Live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die<br />
          live the life of a boss playa, cause even gettin high..<br />
          <br />
          [Syke]<br />
          Heeyyy, to my nigga 'Pac..<br />
          So much trouble in the world, nigga<br />
          Can't nobody feel your pain<br />
          The world's changin everyday, times moving faaast<br />
          My girl said I need a raise, how long will she last?<br />
          I'm caught between my woman, and my pistol, and my chips<br />
          Triple beam, got some smokers on, whistle as I dip<br />
          I'm lost in the land with no plan, livin life flawless<br />
          Crime boss, contraband, let me toss this<br />
          Needy hookers got a lot of nerve, let my bucket swerve<br />
          I'm takin off from the curb<br />
          The nervousness neglect make me pack a tec<br />
          Devoted to servin this, Moet and paaayyy-checks<br />
          Like Akai satellite nigga I'm forever ballin<br />
          It ain't right parasites triggers and fleas crawlin<br />
          Sucker duck and get busted, no emotion<br />
          My devotion is handlin my business nigga keep on coastin<br />
          Where you goin I been there came back as lonely homie<br />
          Steady flowin against the grain niggaz STILL don't know me<br />
          It's about the money in this rap shit, this crap shit<br />
          It ain't funny niggaz don't even know how to act - shit!<br />
          What can I do, what can I say, is there another way?<br />
          Blunts and gin all day, twenty-fo' parlay<br />
          My little homie G, can't you see, I'm busta free<br />
          Niggaz can't stand me - all eyes on me!<br />
          <br />
          [Chorus Two: 2Pac]<br />
          <br />
          I live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die<br />
          Live the life as a boss playa {All Eyez On Me}<br />
          cause even gettin high {All Eyez On Me}<br />
          I live the life of a thug nigga, until the day I die<br />

          The feds is watchin, niggaz plottin to get me<br />
          Will I survive, will I die? Come on let's picture the possibility<br />
          Givin me charges, lawyers makin a grip<br />
          I told the judge I was raised wrong, and that's why I blaze shit<br />
          Was hyper as a kid, cold as a teenager<br />
          On my mobile callin big shots on the scene major<br />
          Packing hundreds in my drawers; fuck the law<br />
          Bitches I fuck with a passion, I'm livin rough and raw<br />
          Catchin cases at a fast rate, ballin in the fast lane<br />
          Hustle til the mornin, never stopped until the cash came<br />
          Live my life as a thug nigga, until the day I die<br />
          Live my life as a boss playa, cause even gettin high<br />
          these niggaz got me tossin shit<br />
          I put the top down, now it's time to floss my shit<br />
          Keep your head up nigga, make these motherfuckers suffer<br />
          Up in the Benz burnin rubber<br />
          The money is mandatory, the hoes is fully strapped<br />
          This criminal lifestyle, equipped with the bulletproof vest<br />
          Make sure your eyes is on the meal ticket<br />
          Get your money motherfucker let's get rich and we'll kick it<br />
          All eyes on me!<br />

        <div class="actualDescription contents">
          "All Eyez On Me" is a song by Tupac Amaru Shakur, an American rapper,
          activist, and actor. He is considered one of the greatest and most
          influential rappers of all time, despite his brief music career. The
          song opens the album of the same title and talks about how Pac became
          a rap star with significant success despite the difficulties he faced
          in the past, such as poverty, racism experienced at school, and lack
          of help from the state, which gave him the strength to find an outlet
          in music from that situation of discomfort. In fact, the song, and the
          album, covers themes such as crime, politics, love, racism, and life
          on the streets. In the song, Pac acknowledges his position as a leader
          in the world of hip hop and, referring to his power, encourages all
          boys who identify with his past to try to improve their lives without
          resorting to crime. The song's lyrics reflect his desire to be
          respected and admired as an artist, but also the awareness of the need
          to protect himself and his reputation from media attacks and enemies.
          The song helped make the album "All Eyez On Me" one of the biggest
          commercial and cultural successes in the history of hip hop. It is his
          fourth album, and the title of the album refers to his fame and
          personal situation at the time, when he had many eyes on him. "All
          Eyez on Me" was the first hip hop album to be released after Pac was
          released from prison, where he served a sentence for alleged sexual
          assault. The album has sold more than ten million copies in the United
          States and has been certified Diamond by the Recording Industry
          Association of America (RIAA), becoming one of the few albums in music
          history to receive such certification.
