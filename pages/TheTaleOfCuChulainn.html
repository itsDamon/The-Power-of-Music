          In the sodden snow of the Irish hills<br />
          Was born a Tuatha's child<br />
          With a fighting heart and immortal skill<br />
          And a spirit fiery and wild<br />
          <br />
          Through a prophecy he was bound and doomed<br />
          To a short and a glorious life<br />
          And he bore the name Setanta till<br />
          A famous fateful night<br />
          <br />
          With his hurley in his hands<br />
          His name would cross the land<br />
          <br />
          Well his Uncle Connor who wore the crown<br />
          Of Ulster on his head<br />
          In the home of Culainn the smith sat down<br />
          For mead and mutton and bread<br />
          <br />
          At the door lay the Cú, the faithful hound<br />
          A huge and and terrible beast<br />
          When a thief or enemy trod his ground<br />
          Their bones became his feast<br />
          <br />
          Well Setanta joined them late at night<br />
          And the hound it leapt to shred<br />
          But he raised his hurley, pucked the ball<br />
          Right through the poor beast's head<br />
          <br />
          He spoke remorse as the smith he cried<br />
          For his lost and murdered hound<br />
          'I will be your Cú now from this night<br />
          Till another you have found'<br />
          <br />
          So he lay outside the door<br />
          One eye watching on the moors<br />
          <br />
          And the name Cú Chulainn<br />
          Was sung out loud that night<br />
          In a tale of rage and ruin and of might<br />
          And the name Cú Chulainn<br />
          So furious and wild<br />
          To remain in myth and memory<br />
          A legend of the isle<br />

          Finscéal an Chú<br />
          (Legend of the hound)<br />
          <br />
          He trained on the Isle of Sky and Shadow<br />
          Bore an abandoned son<br />
          And met his battle brother Ferdiad<br />
          Many a tale they spun<br />
          <br />
          Well he fought with the strength of many men<br />
          A beast who bloodied the fields<br />
          In a bloodlust battle frenzy<br />
          His skin would shift and peel<br />
          <br />
          His son would find him as man<br />
          But would not tell his name<br />
          So he took a spear to his own child<br />
          And doomed himself to shame<br />
          <br />
          When the canny Queen Méabh attacked his land<br />
          To steal the bull of brown<br />
          She sent out Ferdiad to fight<br />
          Cú Chualainn struck him down<br />
          <br />
          Blood of son and brother fell<br />
          He wailed and cried farewell<br />
          <br />
          And the name Cú Chulainn<br />
          Was sung out loud that night<br />
          In a tale of rage and ruin and of might<br />
          And the name Cú Chulainn<br />
          So furious and wild<br />

          <br />
          When the father of fair Emer<br />
          Refused to give her to wed<br />
          Cú Chulainn tore his castle down<br />
          And left the whole place dead<br />
          <br />
          They loved eachother, man and wife<br />
          Despite his many affairs<br />
          Then he met the Morrigan, turned her down<br />
          And earned her vengeful glare<br />
          <br />
          She weakened him and broke his strength<br />
          With trickery and lies<br />
          By feeding him the flesh of dogs<br />
          Three crones were her disguise<br />
          <br />
          The Queen and Lugaid saw their chance<br />
          To fight the Cú and win<br />
          When he battled next 3 spears were thrown<br />
          And one tore through his skin<br />
          <br />
          So he tied himself to a mighty stone<br />
          By his guts and belt he hung<br />
          And so he still stood on his feet<br />
          Till the last breath it left his lungs<br />
          <br />
          And a light shone out so grand<br />
          Till the raven came to land<br />
          <br />
          And the name Cú Chulainn<br />
          Was sung out loud that night<br />
          In a tale of rage and ruin and of might<br />
          And the name Cú Chulainn<br />

          The song tells the legend of the Celtic warrior hero of Irish
          mythology.<br />
          The song tells of his birth in the hills of Ireland, his upbringing
          and training on the Isle of Sky and Shadow, his exploits including
          challenges with his Uncle Connor,<br />
          defeating the monstrous hound of Culainn, and defending Ulster from
          the Queen Méabh, his brief but intense romance with Emer, and
          ultimately his death by the hand of Lugaid.<br />
          Despite his shortened life, Cú Chulainn is remembered for his courage
          and legendary skill, to this day. The song wants to pay tribute to
          this iconic Celtic hero<br />
          and celebrate the legend of Cú Chulainn as a timeless reminder of
          courage, strength, and honour.<br />

        Cú Chulainn, called the Hound of Ulster, is a warrior hero and demigod
        in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology,<br />
        as well as in Scottish and Manx folklore. He is believed to be an
        incarnation of the Irish god Lugh, who is also his father.<br />
        His mother is the mortal Deichtine, sister of king Conchobar mac
        Nessa.<br />
        Born Sétanta, he gained his better-known name as a child, after killing
        Culann's fierce guard dog in self defence<br />
        and offering to take its place until a replacement could be raised, so
        he became the "Hound (cú) of Culann".<br />
        He was trained in martial arts by Scáthach, who gave him the spear Gáe
        Bulg. It was prophesied that his great feats would give him everlasting
        fame,<br />
        but that his life would be short. At the age of seventeen he defended
        Ulster single-handedly against the armies of queen Medb of Connacht in
        the famous Táin Bó Cúailnge<br />
        ("Cattle Raid of Cooley"). He is known for his terrifying battle frenzy
        (ríastrad), in which he becomes an unrecognisable monster who knows
        neither friend or enemy.<br />
        He fights from his chariot, driven by his loyal charioteer Láeg and
        drawn by his horses, Liath Macha and Dub Sainglend.<br />
        Cú Chulainn's wife is Emer, although he has many other lovers.<br />
        With Aífe he has a son named Connla, whom Cú Chulainn tragically kills.
        Cú Chulainn himself is said to have died in battle,<br />
        binding himself to a standing stone so he can die on his feet. He later
        became an icon for Irish nationalists.<br />
