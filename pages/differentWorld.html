          All we know<br />
          Left untold<br />
          Beaten by a broken dream<br />
          Nothing like what it used to be<br />
          (Used to be)<br />
          We've been chasing our demons down an empty road<br />
          Been watching our castle turning into dust<br />
          Escaping our shadows just to end up here, once more<br />
          And we both know<br />
          This is not the world we had in mind<br />
          But we got time<br />
          We are stuck on answers we can't find<br />
          But we got time<br />
          And even though we might have lost tonight<br />
          The skyline reminds us of a different time<br />
          This is not the world we had in mind<br />
          But we got time<br />
          Broken smile, tired eyes<br />
          I can feel your longing heart<br />
          Call my name, howling from afar<br />
          We've been fighting our demons just to stay afloat<br />
          Been building a castle just to watch it fall<br />
          Been running forever just to end up here, once more<br />
          And now we know<br />
          This is not the world we had in mind<br />
          But we got time<br />
          We are stuck on answers we can't find<br />
          But we got time<br />
          And even though we might have lost tonight<br />
          The skyline reminds us of a different time<br />
          This is not the world we had in mind<br />
          But we got time<br />
          Take me back<br />
          Back to the mountainside<br />

          It was meant to describe the world nowadays. It shows that the earth
          has changed much worse in the present day, where we can see most
          pollution everywhere. Air pollution, water pollution, and others. We
          lived in a world that is corrupted. Loss of humanity made us careless
          about our surroundings. Many living things suffered to live here in an
          open world. Animals are struggling to live in their own habitats
          because of the human's greed. Their greed for power, money and fame.
          Humans like us made all of the chaos. All of us wish to save the
          planet and return into its original state. The world that has no
          chaos, no pollution, and safe for everyone to live on.

        Climate change describes a change in the average conditions — such as
        temperature and rainfall — in a region over a long period of time. For
        example, 20,000 years ago, much of the United States was covered in
        glaciers. In the United States today, we have a warmer climate and fewer
        glaciers. Global climate change refers to the average long-term changes
        over the entire Earth. These include warming temperatures and changes in
        precipitation, as well as the effects of Earth’s warming, such as:
        Rising sea levels, Shrinking mountain glaciers, Ice melting at a faster
        rate than usual in Greenland, Antarctica and the Arctic, Changes in
        flower and plant blooming times.
