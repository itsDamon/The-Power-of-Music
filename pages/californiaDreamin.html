        Homesickness is the pain caused by being away from home. His cognitive
        features are reflections on family and attachment figures. Patients
        typically report symptoms of depression and anxiety, withdrawn behavior,
        and difficulty focusing on nonfamily-related issues. Both children and
        adults experience it, those affected may have to travel short distances
        to nearby places. Homesickness promotes the development of coping skills
        and inspires healthy attachment behaviors. Reconnecting with loved ones.
        Almost all people miss things at home when they travel, making
        homesickness an almost universal experience. However, severe
        homesickness can be distressing and debilitating.
