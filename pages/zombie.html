          Another head hangs lowly<br />
          Child is slowly taken<br />
          And the violence caused such silence<br />
          Who are we mistaken?<br />
          But you see, it's not me<br />
          It's not my family<br />
          In your head, in your head, they are fighting<br />
          With their tanks and their bombs<br />
          And their bombs and their guns<br />
          In your head, in your head, they are crying<br />
          In your head, in your head<br />
          Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie<br />
          What's in your head, in your head?<br />
          Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh<br />
          Do, do, do, do<br />
          Do, do, do, do<br />
          Do, do, do, do<br />
          Do, do, do, do<br />
          Another mother's breaking<br />
          Heart is taking over<br />
          When the violence causes silence<br />
          We must be mistaken<br />
          It's the same old theme<br />
          Since nineteen-sixteen<br />
          In your head, in your head, they're still fighting<br />
          With their tanks and their bombs<br />
          And their bombs and their guns<br />
          In your head, in your head, they are dying<br />
          In your head, in your head<br />
          Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie<br />
          What's in your head, in your head?<br />
          Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie<br />
          Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh oh, ya-ya<br />

        When the song was composed in the North of Ireland tragic events were
        taking place: <br />
        the IRA was rampant with its terrorist acts directed against the British
        government and the clashes between the two fronts <br />
        became more and more heated day after day. On Sunday, March 20, 1993,
        many families with children were out shopping for gifts for Mother’s
        Day. <br />
        Just that day in Warringston, Cheshire, the IRA placed bombs in two
        metal dumpsters.In that terrorist action 54 people were injured and 12
        died.<br />
        The song is the band’s response to those atrocities that shocked
        everyone: not surprisingly, the wonderful lyrics of the song talk about
        violence, <br />
        mothers heartbroken by the loss of their children, the silence and pain
        caused by those terrorist acts. The musicians with this song wanted to
        condemn<br />
        those acts committed by some of their compatriots, taking clear
        distances to launch instead a message of peace.<br />
