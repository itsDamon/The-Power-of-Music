          Born down in a dead man's town<br />
          And the first kick I took was when I hit the ground<br />
          You end up like a dog that's been beat too much<br />
          'Til you spend half your life just to cover up<br />
          Born in the U.S.A.<br />
          I was born in the U.S.A.<br />
          I was born in the U.S.A.<br />
          Born in the U.S.A.<br />
          Got in a little hometown jam<br />
          So they put a rifle in my hand<br />
          Sent me off to a foreign land<br />
          To go and kill the yellow man<br />
          Born in the U.S.A.<br />
          I was born in the U.S.A.<br />
          I was born in the U.S.A.<br />

          Come back home to the refinery<br />
          Hiring man says, "Son, if it was up to me"<br />
          I go down to see the V.A. man<br />
          He said, "Son, don't you understand?"<br />
          Had a brother at Khe Sahn<br />
          Fighting off the Viet Cong<br />
          They're still there, he's all gone<br />
          He had a little girl in Saigon<br />
          I got a picture of him in her arms<br />
          Down in the shadow of the penitentiary<br />
          Out by the gas fires of the refinery<br />
          I'm ten years burning down the road<br />
          I've got nowhere to run and nowhere to go<br />
          Born in the U.S.A.<br />
          I was born in the U.S.A.<br />
          I was born in the U.S.A.<br />
          I'm a long time daddy in the U.S.A.<br />
          I was born in the U.S.A.<br />
          I'm a cool rocking daddy in the U.S.A.<br />

          Springsteen wrote it about the problems Vietnam veterans met when they
          returned home. Vietnam was the first war the US didn’t win, and while
          veterans of other wars received a hero’s welcome, those who fought in
          Vietnam were mostly ignored on their return to the States. Therefore,
          Springsteen decided to pay tribute to these soldiers, some of them
          were his friends and many didnot return from the conflict, and to
          protest the hardships Vietnam veterans had to face when theycame back
          from the war. A superficial listener might think it is a song of
          praise or triumph for America, but, actually, it is an ironic and
          caustic commentary on the hypocrisy of patriotism and on how America
          treated its Vietnam veterans. This is one of the most misinterpreted
          songs ever. This song is often misunderstood as a patriotic anthem and
          in 1984 Ronald Reagan used it as hiscampaign song, but Springsteen
          promptly asked the campaign to stop. He never let his music be used in
          ads to sell products: he even turned down $12 million dollars from
          Chrysler.

        The Vietnam War was a long and brutal conflict that lasted from 1955 to
        1975. The main players were North Vietnam, supported by the Soviet Union
        and China, and South Vietnam, backed by the United States and other
        anti-communist nations. The United States became involved in the
        conflict in the early 1960s, with the aim of preventing the spread of
        communism in Southeast Asia. The conflict escalated into a full-scale
        war, with heavy bombing of North Vietnam and large-scale deployment of
        American troops. Despite their military superiority, American and South
        Vietnamese forces were unable to defeat the communist forces, and the
        war resulted in a stalemate. The Paris Peace Accords were signed in
        1973, but fighting continued until the fall of Saigon in 1975, when
        North Vietnam declared victory and reunified the country under communist
        rule. The war resulted in the loss of hundreds of thousands of lives,
        including many civilians, and had a profound impact on American society,
        leading to widespread protests and a loss of confidence in the
        government. The war also had long-lasting effects on Vietnam, including
        economic hardship and the resettlement of hundreds of thousands of
        refugees. The Vietnam War veterans are those who served in the armed
        forces during the Vietnam War. Many faced physical and emotional trauma,
        including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and exposure to the
        toxic herbicide Agent Orange. Despite their sacrifices, many faced
        difficulties adjusting to civilian life and faced discrimination upon
        returning home. The government has since established programs to support
        and provide resources for these veterans.
