          At home drawing pictures<br>
          Of mountain tops<br>
          With him on top<br>
          Lemon yellow sun<br>
          Arms raised in a V<br>
          And the dead lay in pools of maroon below<br>
          Daddy didn't give attention<br>
          Oh, to the fact that mommy didn't care<br>
          King Jeremy the wicked<br>
          Oh, ruled his world<br>

          Jeremy spoke in class today<br>
          Clearly I remember<br>
          Pickin' on the boy<br>
          Seemed a harmless little fuck<br>
          But we unleashed the lion<br>
          Gnashed his teeth and bit the recess lady's breast<br>
          How could I forget<br>
          And he hit me with a surprise left<br>
          My jaw left hurting<br>
          Dropped wide open<br>
          Just like the day<br>
          Oh, like the day I heard<br>
          Daddy didn't give affection, no<br>
          And the boy was something that mommy wouldn't wear<br>
          King Jeremy the wicked<br>
          Oh ruled his world<br>

          He is fed up with the harassment his comrades inflict on him every day. He is ready for an extreme gesture.<br>
          One day, after telling his teacher, "Ma'am, now I’m gonna do what I came here for," <br>
          she kills herself by shooting herself in the mouth with a 357 Magnum at her classroom door. <br>
          Eddie Vedder reads the news in a newspaper: it is enclosed in a small article. The singer is shocked: a tragedy of the kind relegated in a few lines:<br>
          "That gesture represented the revenge of Jeremy", Vedder comments that adds "the most effective revenge is to live".<br>
          That story reminds Eddie of another student, who he had argued with several years before and who had fired a gun at school. <br>
          And so he decides to write a song that is a desperate cry against that America that provides its children with means to kill<br>
          and kill themselves instead of fortifying their will. The dramatic text of the song, in which Vedder does not limit <br>
          himself to the role of narrator but expresses his emotions.<br>

        younth suicide<br>
        The incidence of suicide is particularly high among young people, representing the largest percentage of total deaths. <br>
        Every year, nearly 46,000 children and adolescents between the ages of 10 and 19 take their own lives around the world, <br>
        about one every eleven minutes. Suicide is the fifth most common cause of death among adolescents aged 10 to 19 and the fourth <br>
        in the 15 to 19 age group (even the third if only girls are considered).<br>
        According to Istat, there are about 4000 young people who take their own lives every year in Italy;<br>
        in 2021 there were 220000 young people between 14 and 19 years of dissatisfied life who, at the same time, <br>
        are in a condition of poor psychological well-being, and the pandemic definitely didn’t help.<br>
