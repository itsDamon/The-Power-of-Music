          With him on top<br />
          Lemon yellow sun<br />
          Arms raised in a V<br />
          And the dead lay in pools of maroon below<br />
          Daddy didn't give attention<br />
          Oh, to the fact that mommy didn't care<br />

          Clearly I remember<br />
          Pickin' on the boy<br />
          Seemed a harmless little fuck<br />
          But we unleashed the lion<br />
          Gnashed his teeth and bit the recess lady's breast<br />
          How could I forget<br />
          And he hit me with a surprise left<br />
          My jaw left hurting<br />
          Dropped wide open<br />

          He is fed up with the harassment his comrades inflict on him every
          day. He is ready for an extreme gesture.<br />
          One day, after telling his teacher, "Ma'am, now I’m gonna do what I
          came here for," <br />
          she kills herself by shooting herself in the mouth with a 357 Magnum
          at her classroom door. <br />
          Eddie Vedder reads the news in a newspaper: it is enclosed in a small
          article. The singer is shocked: a tragedy of the kind relegated in a
          few lines:<br />
          "That gesture represented the revenge of Jeremy", Vedder comments that
          adds "the most effective revenge is to live".<br />
          That story reminds Eddie of another student, who he had argued with
          several years before and who had fired a gun at school. <br />
          And so he decides to write a song that is a desperate cry against that
          America that provides its children with means to kill<br />
          and kill themselves instead of fortifying their will. The dramatic
          text of the song, in which Vedder does not limit <br />
          himself to the role of narrator but expresses his emotions.<br />

        younth suicide<br />
        The incidence of suicide is particularly high among young people,
        representing the largest percentage of total deaths. <br />
        Every year, nearly 46,000 children and adolescents between the ages of
        10 and 19 take their own lives around the world, <br />
        about one every eleven minutes. Suicide is the fifth most common cause
        of death among adolescents aged 10 to 19 and the fourth <br />
        in the 15 to 19 age group (even the third if only girls are
        considered).<br />
        According to Istat, there are about 4000 young people who take their own
        lives every year in Italy;<br />
        in 2021 there were 220000 young people between 14 and 19 years of
        dissatisfied life who, at the same time, <br />
        are in a condition of poor psychological well-being, and the pandemic
        definitely didn’t help.<br />
