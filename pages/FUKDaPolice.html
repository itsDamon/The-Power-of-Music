            Right about now NWA court is in full effect<br/>
            Judge Dre presiding in the case of NWA versus the police
            department.<br/>
            Prosecuting attourneys are MC Ren, Ice Cube and Eazy ***’ E<br/>
            Order, order, order, Ice Cube take the ***' stand<br/>
            Do you swear to tell the truth the whole truth<br/>
            And nothin' but the truth so help your black ***?<br/>
            You goddamn right<br/>
            Well, won't you tell everybody what the *** you gotta say?<br/>
            *** the police comin' straight from the underground<br/>
            A Young *** got it bad 'cause I'm brown<br/>
            And not the other color so police think<br/>
            They have the authority to kill a minority<br/>
            *** that shit, 'cause I ain't the one<br/>
            For a punk *** with a badge and a gun<br/>
            To be beatin' on, and thrown in jail<br/>
            We can go toe-to-toe in the middle of a cell<br/>
            *** with me 'cause I'm a teenager<br/>
            With a little bit of gold and a pager<br/>
            Searchin' my car, lookin' for the product<br/>
            Thinkin' every *** is sellin' narcotics<br/>
            You'd rather see me in the pen<br/>
            Than me and Lorenzo rollin' in the Benzo<br/>
            Beat a police outta shape<br/>
            And when I'm finished, bring the yellow tape<br/>
            To tape off the scene of the slaughter<br/>
            Still getting swole off bread and water<br/>
            I don't know if they *** or what<br/>
            Search a *** down and grabbin' his nuts<br/>
            And on the other hand, without a gun, they can't get none<br/>
            But don't let it be a black and a white one<br/>
            'Cause they'll slam ya down to the street top<br/>
            Black police showin' out for the white cop<br/>
            Ice Cube will swarm<br/>
            On any *** in a blue uniform<br/>
            Just 'cause I'm from the CPT, punk police are afraid of me<br/>
            A young *** on a warpath<br/>
            And when I'm finished, it's gonna be a bloodbath<br/>
            Of cops, dyin' in L.A.<br/>
            Yo Dre, I got somethin' to say<br/>
            ** the police, ** -, *** -<br/>
            ** the police, ** -, *** -<br/>
            ** the police, ** the-, *** the-<br/>
            *** the police (Example of scene one)<br/>
            Pull your goddamn ass over right now<br/>
            Aw shit, now what the *** you pullin' me over for?<br/>
            'Cause I feel like it<br/>
            Just sit your ass on the curb and shut the *** up<br/>
            Man, *** this shit<br/>
            Alright, smart-***, I'm taking your black ass to jail<br/>
            MC Ren, will you please give your testimony<br/>
            To the jury about this *** up incident<br/>
            *** the police and Ren said it with authority<br/>
            Because the niggas on the street is a majority<br/>
            A gang, is with whoever I'm steppin'<br/>
            And the *** ' weapon is kept in<br/>
            A stash spot, for the so-called law<br/>
            Wishin' Ren was a *** that they never saw<br/>
            Lights start flashin' behind me<br/>
            But they're scared of a *** so they mace me to blind me<br/>
            But that *** don't work, I just laugh<br/>
            Because it gives 'em a hint not to step in my path<br/>
            For police, I'm sayin', "*** you, punk"<br/>
            Readin' my rights and shit, it's all junk<br/>
            Pullin' out a silly club, so you stand<br/>
            With a fake-*** badge and a gun in your hand<br/>
            But take off the gun so you can see what's up<br/>
            And we'll go at it, punk, I'ma *** you up<br/>
            Make ya think I'm a kick your ***<br/>
            But drop your gat, and Ren's gonna blast<br/>
            I'm sneaky as *** when it comes to crime<br/>
            But I'm a smoke 'em now, and not next time<br/>
            Smoke any *** that sweats me<br/>
            Or any *** that threatens me<br/>
            I'm a sniper with a hell of a scope<br/>
            Takin' out a cop or two, they can't cope with me<br/>
            The *** ' villian that's mad<br/>
            With potential to get bad as fuck<br/>
            So I'm a turn it around<br/>
            Put in my clip, yo, and this is the sound<br/>
            Yeah, somethin' like that, but it all depends on the size of the
            gat<br/>
            Takin' out a police would make my day<br/>
            But a ** like Ren don't give a ** to say<br/>
            ** the police, ** -, *** -<br/>
            ** the police, ** -, *** -<br/>
            ** the police, ** the-, *** the-<br/>
            *** the police<br/>
            Yeah, man, what you need?<br/>
            Police, open now (Aww, shit)<br/>
            We have a warrant for Eazy-E's arrest<br/>
            Get down and put your hands right where I can see 'em!<br/>
            Man, what the fuck did I do? Man, what did I do?<br/>
            Just shut the fuck up and get your *** ass on the floor!<br/>
            But I didn't do shit<br/>
            Man, just shut the *** up!<br/>
            Eazy-E, won't you step up to the stand<br/>
            And tell the jury how you feel about this ***?<br/>
            I'm tired of the *** ' jackin'<br/>
            Sweatin' my gang while I'm chillin' in the shack, and<br/>
            Shining the light in my face, and for what?<br/>
            Maybe it's because I kick so much butt<br/>
            I kick ***, or maybe 'cause I blast<br/>
            On a stupid ** ** when I'm playin' with the trigger<br/>
            Of any Uzi or an AK<br/>
            'Cause the police always got somethin' stupid to say<br/>
            They put up my picture with silence<br/>
            'Cause my identity by itself causes violence<br/>
            The E with the criminal behavior<br/>
            Yeah, I'm a gangster, but still, I got flavor<br/>
            Without a gun and a badge, what do ya got?<br/>
            A *** in a uniform waitin' to get shot<br/>
            By me, or another nigga.<br/>
            And with a gat, it don't matter if he's smarter or bigger<br/>
            (Size don't mean ***, he's from the old school, fool)<br/>
            And as you all know, E's here to rule<br/>
            Whenever I'm rollin', keep lookin in the mirror<br/>
            And ears on cue, yo, so I can hear a<br/>
            Dumb motherfucker with a gun<br/>
            And if I'm rollin' off the eight, he'll be the one<br/>
            That I take out, and then get away<br/>
            While I'm drivin off laughin'<br/>
            This is what I'll say<br/>
            ** the police, ** -, *** -<br/>
            ** the police, ** -<br/>
            ** the police, ** -, *** -<br/>
            *** the police (The verdict)<br/>
            The jury has found you guilty of being a redneck<br/>
            Whitebread, chicken ** **<br/>
            Wait, that's a lie, that's a goddamn lie<br/>
            Get him out of here (I want justice)<br/>
            Get him the *** out my face (I want justice)<br/>
            Out, right now<br/>

            the song "fuk da police" by NWA, is written with a very direct and
            vulgar language, which aims to denounce the abuses by the police
            against the African-American minority, which existed in those years
            (80s-90s). The film "Straight Outta Compton" tells the story of NWA,
            from its inception to its disbandment. In the Detroit concert scene,
            this song, before the performance, was forbidden to be played by the
            concert security police group, but this prohibition was not respected
            and after a few seconds from the beginning of the song, shots are
            heard which intuitively they come from the police, later the group is
            arrested. This scene is similar to what really happened, because the
            bangs were there but they were cherry bombs and not shots, then the
            restriction would have started from the inner circle of the group, the
            manager of the deceased Eazy-E (one of the singers of the group) Jerry
            Heller agreed in pre-tour negotiations with tour promoter Darryll
            Brooks that the band would be fined $25,000 if they played the song,
            as Brooks feared the song would not be liked by conservative local
            authorities , so the police reacted to the concert on their own.
