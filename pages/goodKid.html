            Mass hallucination, baby<br>
            Ill education, baby<br>
            Want to reconnect with your elations?<br>
            This is your station, baby<br>
            Look inside these walls<br>
            And you see I'm havin' withdrawals of a prisoner on his way<br>
            Trapped inside your desire to fire bullets that stray<br>
            Track attire just tell you I'm tired and ran away<br>
            I should ask a choir "What do you require<br>
            To sing a song that acquire me to have faith?"<br>
            As the record spin I should pray<br>
            For the record, I recognize that I'm easily prey<br>
            I got ate alive yesterday<br>
            I got animosity buildin', it's probably big as a buildin'<br>
            Me jumpin' off of the roof is me just playin' it safe<br>
            But what am I 'posed to do when the topic is red or blue<br>
            And you understand that I ain't?<br>
            But know I'm accustomed to just a couple that look for trouble<br>
            And live in the street with rank<br>
            No better picture to paint than me walkin' from bible study<br>
            And called his homies because he had said he noticed my face<br>
            From a function that tooken place, they was wonderin' if I bang<br>
            Step on my neck and get blood on your Nike checks<br>
            I don't mind 'cause one day you'll respect the good kid, m.A.A.d city<br>
            Mass hallucination, baby<br>
            Ill education, baby<br>
            Want to reconnect with your elations?<br>
            This is your station, baby<br>
            All I see is strobe lights, blinding me in my hindsight<br>
            Finding me by myself, promise me you can help<br>
            In all honesty I got time to be copacetic until<br>
            You had finally made decision to hold me against my will<br>
            It was like a head on collision that folded me standing still<br>
            I can never pick out the difference and grade a cop on the bill<br>
            Every time you clock in the morning, I feel you just want to kill<br>
            All my innocence while ignoring my purpose to persevere as a better person<br>
            I know you heard this and probably in fear<br>
            But what am I 'posed to do with the blinking of red and blue<br>
            Flash from the top of your roof and your dog has to say woof<br>
            And you ask, "Lift up your shirt" 'cause you wonder if a tattoo<br>
            Of affiliation can make it a pleasure to put me through<br>
            Gang files, but that don't matter because the matter is racial profile<br>
            I heard them chatter, "He's probably young but I know that he's down"<br>
            Step on his neck as hard as your bulletproof vest<br>
            He don't mind, he know we'll never respect, the good kid, m.A.A.d. city<br>
            Mass hallucination, baby<br>
            Ill education, baby<br>
            Want to reconnect with your elations?<br>
            This is your station, baby<br>
            All I see in this room, 20's, Xannies and these 'shrooms<br>
            Grown-up candy for pain, can we live in a sane society?<br>
            It's entirely stressful upon my brain<br>
            You hired me as a victim, I quietly hope for change<br>
            When violence is the rhythm, inspired me to obtain<br>
            The silence in this room with 20's, Xannies and 'shrooms<br>
            Some grown-up candy I lost it, I feel it's nothing to lose<br>
            The streets sure to release the worst side of my best<br>
            Don't mind, 'cause now you ever in debt to good kid, m.A.A.d. city<br>
            Mass hallucination, baby<br>
            Ill education, baby<br>
            Want to reconnect with your elations?<br>

            "good kid, m.A.A.d city" is the second studio album by rapper Kendrick Lamar, released in 2012.<br>
            The album is a concept album that tells the story of Lamar's youth in the city of Compton, California, and
            his experiences with violence, crime, and hip-hop culture.<br>
            The title of the album refers to Lamar's identity as a "good kid" amidst the violent and criminal reality of
            the neighborhood in which he grew up,<br>
            and the acronym "m.A.A.d," which stands for "My Angels on Angel Dust" and refers to drug use in his
            community.<br>
            The album is divided into chapters and features a narrative plot that follows Lamar through a night of crime
            and violence,<br>
            in which he and his friends are involved in a shooting, a robbery, and an incident with the police. Along
            the way,<br>
            Lamar deals with themes such as faith, love, family, and peer pressure to conform to street culture.<br>
            The album's music is influenced by 1990s West Coast gangsta rap, but also features jazz, funk and soul
            sounds.<br>
            Lamar's work has received high praise from critics for his ability to portray the reality of life in the
            Compton area,<br>
            as well as his ability to create a coherent and engaging concept album.<br>
            "good kid, m.A.A.d city" was a major commercial success, debuting at No. 2 on the Billboard 200 album chart
            and receiving numerous Grammy Award nominations.<br>
            The album is considered one of the masterpieces of contemporary rap and helped solidify Lamar's position as
            one of the most important rappers of his generation.<br>
