            Ricordo ancora quando mi dicevano<br />
            Che sarebbe stato meglio se io non fossi nato<br />
            Che avrebbero conquistato tutto il mondo<br />
            E che nessun altro li avrebbe più fermati<br />
            Ricordo ancora quando mi dicevano<br />
            Che sarebbe stato meglio se io non fossi nato<br />
            Che avrebbero conquistato tutto il mondo<br />
            E che nessun altro li avrebbe più fermati<br />
            Hey, hai finito di fare lo spaccone?<br />
            Ti credi un re ma in realtà sei soltanto un mozzicone (AHAHAH)<br />
            Abbassa quei toni perché di te, ho zero paura (Zero)<br />
            Tanto ormai si sa, che tra noi due non esiste nessun paragone<br />
            Sarò sempre il migliore perché io sono Coca, e tu sei Pepsi<br />
            Cos’è adesso ti brucia?<br />
            Fra, fai così perché non ti hanno insegnato l’educazione?<br />
            O forse perché tua mamma non è una brava donna?<br />
            Fra ma questi qua anziché lavorare stanno tutto il giorno al
            cellulare<br />
            Poi fanno le storie in cui si dissano solo per fare qualche like<br />
            Bravo scemo, se ti fai applaudire da questa gente significa che hai
            già fallito<br />
            Piuttosto vai a lavare i piatti che venirmi qua senza i veri
            fatti<br />
            Ricchi no<br />
            Ricchi no<br />
            Ma tu continua che la strada è ancora lunga<br />
            Ricchi no<br />
            Ricchi no<br />
            Ricchi no (NO, NO, NO, NO)<br />
            Ricchi no, noi non lo siamo ma un giorno lo saremo<br />
            Tu continua pure a prenderci in giro che tanto prima o poi ti
            supereremo<br />
            Ridi con noi solo perché siamo soli<br />
            Dici di saper rappare meglio di qualunque altro<br />
            Ma smettila, che appena apri bocca si rompe tutto il vetro<br />
            Persino una rana sa farlo meglio<br />
            Fai attenzione, che il Karma torna sempre indietro<br />
            Non aver fretta a nasconderti che ti raggiunge persino se ti metti
            dentro ad un ripostiglio<br />
            Io queste persone le odio<br />
            Le considero peggio del demonio<br />
            Ma non mi fanno paura, mi fanno soltanto pena<br />
            Perché fanno vedere una parte e non tutto il retroscena<br />
            Tu mi insulti dietro ad uno schermo perché non hai il coraggio di
            metterci la faccia<br />
            Allora cosa ci fai ancora qua?<br />
            Te ne potevi pure stare là<br />
            Qua nessuno ha bisogno di te, quindi ritornatene pure dentro nella
            tua cuccia<br />
            Ricordo ancora quando mi dicevano<br />
            Che sarebbe stato meglio se mi avessero abbandonato<br />
            Che soltanto così non avrei più dato fastidio<br />
            E che così non avrei causato danni a qualcun altro<br />

            The lyrics is a song written by an artist who wants to express his
            determination and willpower despite negative comments about his
            physical appearance received in the past, as in the following
            verses:<br />
            "Ricordo ancora quando mi dicevano:<br />
            Che sarebbe stato meglio se io non fossi nato".<br />
            The author prides himself on being superior to his haters and not
            being afraid of them, describing them as envious and incompetent:<br />
            "Hey, hai finito di fare lo spaccone?<br />
            Ti credi un re ma in realtà sei soltanto un mozzicone".<br />
            In addition, the artist highlights the importance of hard work and
            perseverance to achieve one's goals, explaining that although they
            are not rich, one day they will become rich, this is stated in the
            following lines:<br />
            "Ricchi no, noi non lo siamo ma un giorno lo saremo".<br />
            Furthermore, the author focuses on the need to have the courage to
            face one's actions in front of others and not hide behind a screen,
            and concludes that these people are only worthy of pity.<br />
            In summary, the text expresses the will to not give up in the face
            of difficulties and the strength of will to achieve one's goals
            despite criticism from others.<br />

        Music therapy has been successful as a therapeutic intervention for
        persons with physical disabilities. It has been used with persons, of
        all ages from preschool to late adulthood and with many types of
        disabilities whether congenital or adventitious. Music therapy may play
        an important role in developing, maintaining and/or restoring physical
        functioning. Because music is reinforcing, it can be used to motivate
        movements or structure exercises which are prescribed in physical
        rehabilitation. Involvement in music may provide a distraction from the
        pain discomfort, and anxiety often associated with some physical
        disabilities. Musical experiences presented within a music therapy
        sessions can be effective in achieving a variety of physical, emotional
        and social goals relevant to the individuals needs capabilities and
        preferences. Music therapy techniques-have been used to develop and
        maintain joint and muscle function or to increase fine and gross motor
        coordination and control, increase muscle strength, increase range of
        motion, improve cardiopulmonary and respiratory functioning, improve
        oral-motor skills, facilitate relaxation and controlled movement, as
        well as provide an outlet for emotional self-expression and provide
        opportunities for social interaction. Music therapy sessions incorporate
        the use of different musical media to achieve individualized treatment
        goals. Through movement to music and dance routines, movements may
        become more controlled, fluid and purposeful. Recorded or five
        background music may be used. Live music offers increased flexibility
        and adaptability to match and guide physical movements elicited by the
        client. Musical instruments may be used to work on range of motion,
        handgrasp strength, and non-verbal self-expression. These instruments
        are often adapted to fit the specific physical capabilities of each
        client. The use of computer-aided and electronic musical equipment also
        allows severely physically disabled clients to reach their fullest
        creative potential. The act of singing may assist in the maintenance and
        improvement of oral motor skills and pulmonary functioning. Singing
        provides opportunities to improve breath-control, rate of speech,
        articulation and pronunciation skills. For some clients, listening to
        music may facilitate relaxation. Discussion of lyrics and songwriting
        may provide opportunities to discuss and share personal thoughts and
        experiences. Music therapy can increase an individual’s level of
        independence, and enhance feelings of self-confidence, self-worth and
        self-esteem. Through participation in successful and enjoyable
        experiences, music therapy can assist these individuals in reaching
        their fullest potential. Facilitate relaxation Relaxation is an
        important component in achieving increased range of motion and
        flexibility. It is also important when working with persons who have
        difficulties with spasticity. Sedative music has been show to enhance
        EMG biofeedback relaxation training when compared to EMG biofeedback
        relaxation training alone for persons. with spastic cerebral palsy
        (Scartelli, 1982). Music experiences that can promote relaxation include
        listening to carefully chosen music, instrumental improvisation and
        music-assisted relaxation exercises. Improvised music can match and
        guide physiological responses (i.e., respiratory rhythm, pulmonary
        rhythms), toward achieving a more relaxed state. Although most people
        may find sedative music effective in achieving a relaxed state, this may
        not be true in all cases. The music therapist is able to recognize and
        monitor the effects of the presented music on the individual. and to
        adjust the music to ensure that the intended results are achieved.
        Reinforce and provide motivation for physical exercise The use of music
        in therapy provides a positive and enjoyable atmosphere for persons with
        physical disabilities to experience success. Carefully chosen background
        music can enhance regular physical exercise. Through providing live
        background music, adaptability and flexibility is maintained so that the
        music therapist can more easily match the individual’s motions in tempo,
        style and rhythm. Music can help provide distraction and diversion from
        exercises that may be difficult for the individual, provide motivation
        to maintain participation and make a regular exercise routine seem less
        tedious. Foster independence, self-confidence- and self-esteem As
        physical abilities improve, and persons have increased opportunities to
        practice and acquire new skills and abilities, independence can be
        fostered and self-confidence and self-esteem enhanced. A positive
        self-image and self-concept can be developed through music therapy
        interventions (Brodsky, Nierdorf, 1986) and music therapy activities can
        be adapted according to the individual’s needs and capabilities. This
        may involve adapting instruments or songs to make them more accessible
        and to ensure that the musical experience can be successful while
        continuing to provide challenges to the individual. Music therapy can
        help these individuals to develop positive attitudes toward their
        disabilities and provide opportunities for personal growth. Develop
        functional speech and communication abilities Singing and speech have
        many commonalities. The use of vocal exercises used in singing can
        enhance oral motor skills such as articulation, breath control, and
        vocal intensity. Through manipulating tempo and rhythm, clarity of
        speech can be enhanced and the rate of speech can be modified to provide
        increased communication abilities for the individual (Cohen, 1988).
        Rhythmic training has also been shown to be effective in the treatment
        of aphasia (Oepen, Berthold, 1983). Melodic intonation therapy involves
        the sung intonation of propositional sentences in such a way that the
        intoned pattern is similar to the natural prosodic pattern of a sentence
        when it is spoken. This technique has been shown to be effective in
        improving word-morpheme performance levels, sentence lengths,
        articulation skills and intelligibility for language delayed apraxic
        children (Kraus, Galloway, 1982) and has been an effective treatment for
        some persons with severe aphasia (Sparks, Helm, Albert, 1974). Music has
        also been effective as a stimulus to promote spontaneous speech with
        physically challenged children (Harding, Ballard, 1982) and to promote
        non-verbal communication through bliss symbols (Herman, 1985) or sign
        language. Motivate interaction with others Persons with physical
        disabilities may encounter decreased opportunities and motivation for
        social interaction. Music therapy can provide opportunities to interact
        with peers through a shared experience. Group ensembles provide
        opportunities to develop peer relationships, develop social interaction
        skills and provide opportunities for cooperation and working together as
        a group toward a common goal. Group music therapy sessions can also
        provide opportunities to share personal experiences with others and
        provide a means and an outlet for appropriate self-expression.
