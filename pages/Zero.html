          I find it hard to say the things I want to say the most<br />
          Find a little bit of steady as I get close<br />
          Find a balance in the middle of the chaos<br />
          Send me low, send me high, send me never demigod<br />
          I remember walking in the cold of November<br />
          Hoping that I make it to the end of December<br />
          Twenty-seven years and the end of my mind, but<br />
          Holding to the thought of another time, but<br />
          Looking to the ways of the ones before me<br />
          Looking for the path of the young and lonely<br />
          I don't want to hear about what to do<br />
          I don't want to do it just to do it for you<br />
          Hello, hello<br />
          Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero<br />
          Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel<br />
          Like I'm empty and there's nothing really real, real<br />

          I'm looking for a way out<br />
          I find it hard to tell you how I want to run away<br />
          I understand it always makes you feel a certain way<br />
          I find a balance in the middle of the chaos<br />
          Send me up, send me down, semi never demigod<br />
          I remember walking in the heat of the summer<br />
          Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder<br />
          Twenty-seven years and I've nothing to show<br />
          Falling from the doves to the dark of the crow<br />
          Looking to the ways of the ones before me<br />
          Looking for the path of the young and lonely<br />
          I don't want to hear about what to do, no<br />

          In this song by imagine dragons, called zero. Talk about identity and
          loneliness.<br />
          The meaning of the song is in the self-acceptance.<br />
          as the singer says, there are two problems that are part of this
          generation of the internet.<br />
          He talks about a serious problem, but in the song he expresses it in a
          very funny way, using simple and playful images.<br />
          In this song he wants to express the sense of not being understood,
          which refers to a sense of sadness.<br />
          in the official video of the song he expresses it using a gaming
          environment, like going to the cinema, but still feeling alone.<br />

        loneliness and depression are very common problems in this society,
        often we don't talk about them we try to hide these emotions.<br />
        Sometimes these conditions become very serious, that you can no longer
        bear the weight and end up hurting yourself.<br />
        It can also have a negative impact on mental health leading to a risk of
        anxiety, low self-esteem, sleep problems and stress.<br />
        It can affect individuals of any age, even the elderly.<br />
        this choice can take place by personal choice, by personal events or
        things that have happened in life, some people despite their loneliness
        manage to be happy.<br />
        Loneliness can be caused by various factors, such as:<br />
        Lack of meaningful social relationships: If a person doesn't have enough
        social contacts or has no meaningful relationships in their life, they
        may feel lonely.<br />
        Separation or Loss of a Loved One: The loss of a loved one, through
        death or separation, can lead to feelings of loneliness and sadness.<br />
        Relocation or change of environment: Moving to a new place or
        environment can lead to feelings of isolation and loneliness, <br />
        especially if the person has not yet established new relationships.<br />
        Mental health issues: Certain mental health conditions, such as
        depression or anxiety, can lead to feelings of loneliness.<br />
        Physical health issues: Illness or injury that limits daily activities
        or social participation can lead to loneliness.<br />
        Another important factor mentioned in the song is identity, that is the
        perception that each individual has of himself, <br />
        but also of his own awareness of existing, for example family, friends,
        nationality.<br />
        identity arises from an important question: "who am I?" and above all
        "who am I in relation to others?" and "who are the others in relation to
        me?".<br />
        Identity is very important because it is a constitutive trait of our
        personality that allows us to define ourselves, <br />
        to present ourselves to the world and to make ourselves recognizable,
        therefore it is the mutual recognition between society and the
        individual<br />
