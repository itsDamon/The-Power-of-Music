          Can you save my bastard soul?<br />
          Will you wait for me?<br />
          I'm sorry, brothers, so sorry, lover<br />

          I'm scared to get close, and I hate being alone<br />
          I long for that feeling to not feel at all<br />

          the song discusses the antifraction between not wanting to be alone
          and the desire to have someone by one's side to stand by one's side
          and the internal struggle between one's demons.

        Many people suffer in tranquillity, some people create problems when
        everything goes well, because they have never been well, and when things
        go as they should, they feel uncomfortable, this happens when you carry
        chaos inside you. the desire to want to be recognised as someone who
        exists and someone's affection or love is a very normal feeling but for
        some people this clashes with the unhealthy feeling of feeling isolated,
        as if they do not exist or are excluded from the world these inner
        demons have to be faced, running away from oneself will never make them
        feel free but above all, they will never feel accepted and will never
        appreciate themselves as much as they should.
