          The text begins with Silent Bob admitting to being an alcoholic, but
          also claiming that alcohol is not a problem. This statement may seem
          contradictory, but in reality Silent Bob is trying to debunk the myth
          that alcoholism is simply a matter of willpower or lack of
          self-control. Alcoholism is a disease that affects many people and can
          be difficult to manage. Silent Bob explains that alcoholism is not
          just a matter of drinking too much, but is an addiction that can
          control a person's life. He argues that people tend to judge
          alcoholics as weak or irresponsible Individuals, but in reality it is
          a disease that can affect anyone, regardless of their background or
          social status. The text continues with Silent Bob discussing the
          negative effects of alcoholism on an alcoholic's health and social
          life. He admits that alcoholism has caused him many problems in life,
          such as job loss and relationships, and that it has put his health at
          risk. However, Silent Bob insists that alcohol is not the real
          problem, but the lack of support and resources to help alcoholics
          overcome their addiction. He argues that alcoholics need support from
          family, friends, and the community to overcome their addiction, and
          that society should provide more resources and care for alcoholics. In
          conclusion, the text "L'alcol non è un problema" by Silent Bob is a
          reflection on the nature of alcoholism and the need to provide support
          and care.

        Young people may try a number of substances, including alcohol,
        household chemicals (inhalants), prescription and over-the-counter
        medicines, illegal drugs, and cigarettes. They use alcohol more than any
        other substance. They use alcohol and cannabis (marijuana) more than any
        other substances. Young people use these substances for many of the same
        reasons that adults do—to relax or feel good. But they may also have
        other reasons for using substances. For example, they may want to know
        what it feels like to get high. Or they may want to rebel against their
        parents or fit in with their friends. Using alcohol or drugs can affect
        young people's general health, physical growth, and emotional and social
        development. It can also change how well they make decisions, how well
        they think, and how quickly they can react. And using alcohol or drugs
        can make it hard for young people to control their actions. For some
        young people, alcohol or drug use may turn into a substance use problem.
        Parents can play a key part in teaching their children about alcohol and
        drug use by talking honestly and openly about the effects that alcohol
        and drugs can have on their children's health, schoolwork, and
        relationships. Facts About Alcohol and Drug Use in Young People
        Substance use still remains a leading cause of injury and death in young
        people. It also causes social and health problems.1 Even casual use of
        certain drugs can cause severe health problems, such as an overdose or
        brain damage. Many illegal drugs today are made in home labs, so they
        can vary greatly in strength. These drugs also may contain bacteria,
        dangerous chemicals, and other unsafe substances. There is no quality
        control for illegal drugs like that required for prescription drugs.
        What happens when young people use alcohol or drugs? Alcohol and drugs
        target a part of the brain that allows people to feel pleasure. This
        causes the brain to release certain chemicals that make people feel
        good. At first, these substances may make a person feel happy,
        energetic, social, self-confident, and powerful. But after the "high"
        from the alcohol or drug wears off, he or she may feel the opposite
        effects. Depending on the substance used, a person may feel tired,
        anxious, or depressed after the substance wears off. Or he or she may be
        more sensitive to pain, have sleep problems, lose interest in everyday
        activities, or withdraw from family and friends. Since the pleasure only
        lasts a short time, people crave more of the substance to get the good
        feeling back. Over time, the brain adjusts to the substance by making
        less of the "feel good" chemicals. With less of these chemicals, the
        brain can't function as well, and it becomes harder to feel pleasure. So
        people use alcohol or drugs to get the good feeling back. Alcohol and
        drugs also affect the parts of the brain that deal with judgment,
        decision making, problem solving, emotions, learning, and memory. They
        change how the cells in the brain send and process information. These
        changes in the brain make it harder for people to think and make good
        choices. And they may be less able to control their actions. What
        substances do young people use? Young people use alcohol and cannabis
        (marijuana) more than any other substances. Below is a list of the type
        of substances young people may use and what problems they may cause.
        Alcohol The leading cause of death for young people is car crashes
        related to alcohol. Drinking also can lead young people to have
        unprotected sex. This raises the chance of pregnancy and infection with
        sexually transmitted infections, such as herpes, chlamydia, and HIV.
        Drinking too much alcohol can harm the liver, pancreas, heart, brain,
        and nervous system. It can also cause some cancers. If used during
        pregnancy, alcohol can harm a developing baby (fetus). Alcohol can also
        cause mood swings and affect young people's sleep and their ability to
        think, learn, reason, remember, and solve problems. Young people should
        wait at least until they are in their late teenage years to drink
        alcohol. They should follow the laws for the legal drinking age where
        they live. If you allow your teenagers to drink, make sure that they
        drink no more than 1 or 2 standard drinks and no more than once or twice
        a week and are under your supervision. Cannabis Cannabis (marijuana) can
        affect young people's ability to think, learn, reason, remember, and
        solve problems. It can also cause mood swings, anxiety, and depression.
        Cocaine Cocaine can cause abnormal heartbeats, which may cause a deadly
        heart attack, seizure, or stroke. Its use can also increase the risk of
        car crashes and violent behaviour. The chance of these things happening
        increases when cocaine is combined with alcohol. Other substances Other
        substances young people use include: • Inhalants (glues, aerosol sprays,
        gasoline, paints, and paint thinners). These are some of the substances
        most frequently used by junior high students, because they don't cost
        much and are easy to get. They contain poisons that can harm the brain.
        They can also damage the liver, kidneys, blood, or bone marrow. • Club
        drugs, like ecstasy (MDMA) and date rape drugs such as
        gamma-hydroxybutyrate (GHB), flunitrazepam (Rohypnol), and ketamine.
        These drugs are often used at all-night dances, raves, or trances. The
        number of young people using these drugs is small compared with those
        using cigarettes, alcohol, and marijuana. But these drugs can be
        dangerous, especially in overdose or when combined with alcohol or other
        drugs. Some of these drugs can cause a person to have trouble breathing,
        to pass out, or to be conscious but unable to move. Some of them can
        also lead to thought and memory problems, anxiety, depression, overdose,
        and date rape. • Methamphetamine (commonly called meth, crank, or
        speed). Methamphetamine can cause seizures; stroke; serious mental
        health issues, including paranoia, hallucinations, and delusions; and
        long-term health problems. • Hallucinogens, including LSD, mescaline,
        psilocybin, PCP (phencyclidine), and ketamine. Serious and lasting
        problems such as psychosis or hallucinogenic flashbacks can occur after
        a young person uses LSD. • Opioids, such as heroin, morphine, and
        codeine. Young people who are dependent on these drugs may steal,
        prostitute themselves, or resort to other dangerous or illegal behaviour
        to buy drugs. Some of these drugs can cause lung problems, harm the
        liver and kidneys, cause infections like hepatitis and HIV if the person
        uses shared injection equipment and fluids, and lead to overdose. •
        Prescription drugs, such as diazepam (for example, Valium) and
        methylphenidate (Ritalin). Young people misuse these drugs as well as
        non-prescription medicines such as cough syrups and cold pills to get
        high. • Anabolic steroids, which young people use to build muscle tissue
        and decrease body fat. Steroids can cause liver cancer and increase the
        risk of heart attack and stroke. • Energy drinks, such as Red Bull,
        Monster, or Rockstar. Many young people consume these drinks to help
        them stay awake, feel more energized, and perform better in school and
        sports. These drinks contain high levels of caffeine and other
        stimulants, which can cause anxiety, abnormal heartbeats, high blood
        pressure, dehydration, and other serious problems. When energy drinks
        are combined with alcohol or drugs, the effects can be even more
        harmful. For example, many young people mistakenly think that stimulants
        such as caffeine can undo the effects of alcohol or sober them up before
        driving, but this is not the case. So they may drink more than they
        normally would have, and be more likely to engage in risky behaviours
        such as drinking and driving. Young people also use tobacco. Because the
        effects of cigarettes are felt right away, they may be the most
        habit-forming substance available. Smoking can cause cancer and heart
        and lung problems. Smokeless tobacco like chew or snuff can cause dental
        problems and cancers of the mouth. Why Some Young People Use Alcohol and
        Drugs For many young people, using alcohol or drugs is just part of
        growing up. They may use substances for many reasons. They may want to:
        • Fit in with friends or certain groups. • Be social and have fun. •
        Feel good. • Seem more grown up. • Rebel against parents. • Escape
        problems. For example, they may use a substance to try to: • Get rid of
        symptoms of mental health issues such as attention deficit hyperactivity
        disorder (ADHD) or depression. • Ease feelings of insecurity. • Forget
        about physical or sexual abuse. Young people tend to try new things and
        take risks, so they may use alcohol or drugs because it seems exciting.
        Is Your Child Using Alcohol or Drugs? It can sometimes be hard to tell
        if your child is using alcohol or drugs. Parents may worry that their
        child is involved with alcohol or drugs if he or she becomes withdrawn
        or negative. But these behaviours are common for young people going
        through challenging times. It's important not to accuse your child
        unfairly. Try to find out why your child's behaviour has changed. Tell
        him or her that you are concerned. Experts recommend that parents look
        for a pattern or a number of changes in appearance, behaviour, and
        attitude, not just one or two of the changes listed here. Change in
        appearance • Less attention paid to dressing and grooming • Loss of
        appetite or unexplained weight loss • Red and glassy eyes and frequent
        use of eyedrops and breath mints Change in behaviour • Decreased
        attendance and performance at school • Loss of interest in school,
        sports, or other activities • Newly developed secrecy, or deceptive or
        sneaky behaviour • Withdrawal from family and friends • New friends, and
        reluctance to introduce them • Lying or stealing Change in attitude •
        Disrespectful behaviour • A mood or attitude that is getting worse •
        Lack of concern about the future It's important to remember that drugs
        can include more than illegal drugs. Young people could also have
        problems with medicines a doctor prescribes or medicines they can buy
        without a prescription. What should you do if you find out that your
        child is using alcohol or drugs? If you think that your child is using
        alcohol or drugs, one of the most important things you can do is to talk
        honestly and openly with him or her. Urge your child to do the same.
        This may be a hard conversation to have. Try not to use harsh, judging
        words. Be as supportive as you can. Let your child know that you were
        his or her age once and can understand how hard it can be to say "no"
        when someone offers alcohol or drugs. When talking with your child about
        alcohol or drug use: • Ask about use. Find out what substances your
        child has tried, what effects the substances had, and how he or she
        feels about substance use. Listen carefully to what your child liked
        about using the substance and why. • Share concerns. Talk about your
        concerns, not only about your child's alcohol or drug use but also about
        other problems that may be going on, such as problems at school or with
        friends. • Review expectations. Talk with your child about family rules
        concerning substance use and what might happen when rules are broken. If
        you think your child may have a substance use problem, talk with your
        doctor or a counsellor. Or call your local alcohol or drug helpline to
        find out what resources are available in your area that can help your
        child manage his or her alcohol or drug problem.
