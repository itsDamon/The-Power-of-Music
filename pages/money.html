          Money<br />
          It's a gas<br />
          Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash<br />
          New car, caviar, four star, daydream<br />
          Think I'll buy me a football team<br />
          Money<br />
          Get back<br />
          I'm alright, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack<br />
          Money<br />
          It's a hit<br />
          Don't give me that do goody good bullshit<br />
          I'm in the high-fidelity first-class traveling set<br />
          And I think I need a Lear jet<br />
          Money<br />
          It's a crime<br />
          Share it fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie<br />
          Money<br />
          So they say<br />
          Is the root of all evil today<br />
          But if you ask for a rise<br />
          It's no surprise that they're giving none away<br />
          Away, away, away<br />
          Away, away, away<br />
          I was in the right<br />
          Yes, absolutely in the right<br />
          I certainly was in the right<br />
          Yeah, I was definitely in the right, that geezer was cruisin' for a
          bruisin'<br />
          Yeah!<br />
          Why does anyone do anything?<br />
          I don't know, I was really drunk at the time<br />
          Just telling him it was in, he could get it in number two<br />
          He was asking why it wasn't coming up on freight eleven<br />
          And after, I was yelling and screaming and telling him why<br />

          The morbid attachment to money on the part of contemporary society
          generates all kinds of wickedness.<br />
          From psychoanalytic personal problems to continuing dissatisfaction
          with career failure, bourgeoisie<br />
          seeks to overturn that triad of traditional values
          (spirit-hierarchy-aristocracy).<br />
          The golden calf is all in all preferred by far to any personal and
          family value.<br />
          And, though criticized, money remains the real engine of the world
          around us.<br />

        The economic crisis has changed the habits of a very large part of the
        population.<br />
        The way of life has been transformed especially in the field of saving:
        it is spent for the things strictly<br />
        necessary and much less for those superfluous. Pulling out your wallet
        has become more complicated and saving one of the main goals when you
        leave home.<br />
        Trying not to spend too much can become an obsession turning into a real
        "savings syndrome".<br />
        In the United States, psychologists have renamed this disorder
        "hyperopia", synonymous with the better known term hypermetropia.<br />
        But why? Because, just like in the case of visual impairment, people who
        are obsessed with saving only have a long-term view<br />
        but cannot live in the present because of the fear of not having enough
        money in the future. This forced saving, however,<br />
        can cause depression and moodiness, making the present more
        complicated.<br />
