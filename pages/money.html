          Get away<br>
          You get a good job with more pay and you're okay<br>
          Money<br>
          It's a gas<br>
          Grab that cash with both hands and make a stash<br>
          New car, caviar, four star, daydream<br>
          Think I'll buy me a football team<br>
          Money<br>
          Get back<br>
          I'm alright, Jack, keep your hands off of my stack<br>
          Money<br>
          It's a hit<br>
          Don't give me that do goody good bullshit<br>
          I'm in the high-fidelity first-class traveling set<br>
          And I think I need a Lear jet<br>
          Money<br>
          It's a crime<br>
          Share it fairly, but don't take a slice of my pie<br>
          Money<br>
          So they say<br>
          Is the root of all evil today<br>
          But if you ask for a rise<br>
          It's no surprise that they're giving none away<br>
          Away, away, away<br>
          Away, away, away<br>
          I was in the right<br>
          Yes, absolutely in the right<br>
          I certainly was in the right<br>
          Yeah, I was definitely in the right, that geezer was cruisin' for a bruisin'<br>
          Yeah!<br>
          Why does anyone do anything?<br>
          I don't know, I was really drunk at the time<br>
          Just telling him it was in, he could get it in number two<br>
          He was asking why it wasn't coming up on freight eleven<br>
          And after, I was yelling and screaming and telling him why<br>
          It wasn't coming up on freight eleven<br>

          The morbid attachment to money on the part of contemporary society generates all kinds of wickedness.<br>
          From psychoanalytic personal problems to continuing dissatisfaction with career failure, bourgeoisie<br>
          seeks to overturn that triad of traditional values (spirit-hierarchy-aristocracy).<br>
          The golden calf is all in all preferred by far to any personal and family value.<br>
          And, though criticized, money remains the real engine of the world around us.<br>

        The economic crisis has changed the habits of a very large part of the population.<br>
        The way of life has been transformed especially in the field of saving: it is spent for the things strictly<br>
        necessary and much less for those superfluous. Pulling out your wallet has become more complicated and saving one of the main goals when you leave home.<br>
        Trying not to spend too much can become an obsession turning into a real "savings syndrome".<br>
        In the United States, psychologists have renamed this disorder "hyperopia", synonymous with the better known term hypermetropia.<br>
        But why? Because, just like in the case of visual impairment, people who are obsessed with saving only have a long-term view<br>
        but cannot live in the present because of the fear of not having enough money in the future. This forced saving, however,<br>
        can cause depression and moodiness, making the present more complicated.<br>
