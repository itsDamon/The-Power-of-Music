            I've been on the low<br>
            I been taking my time<br>
            I feel like I'm out of my mind<br>
            It feel like my life ain't mine<br>
            Who can relate? Woo<br>
            I've been on the low<br>
            I been taking my time<br>
            I feel like I'm out of my mind<br>
            It feel like my life ain't mine<br>
            I don't wanna be alive<br>
            I don't wanna be alive<br>
            I just wanna die today<br>
            I just wanna die<br>
            I don't wanna be alive<br>
            I don't wanna be alive<br>
            I just wanna die<br>
            And let me tell you why<br>
            All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout, they think they know it<br>
            I've been prayin' for somebody to save me, no one's heroic<br>
            And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it<br>
            I know I'm hurtin' deep down but can't show it<br>
            I never had a place to call my own<br>
            I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone<br>
            Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?<br>
            They say every life precious but nobody care about mine<br>
            I've been on the low<br>
            I been taking my time<br>
            I feel like I'm out of my mind<br>
            It feel like my life ain't mine<br>

            I've been on the low<br>
            I been taking my time<br>
            I feel like I'm out of my mind<br>
            It feel like my life ain't mine<br>
            I want you to be alive<br>
            I want you to be alive<br>
            You don't gotta die today<br>
            You don't gotta die<br>
            I want you to be alive<br>
            I want you to be alive<br>
            You don't gotta die<br>
            Now let me tell you why<br>
            It's the very first breath<br>
            When your head's been drownin' underwater<br>
            And it's the lightness in the air<br>
            When you're there, chest to chest with a lover<br>
            It's holdin' on, though the road's long<br>
            And seein' light in the darkest things<br>
            And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowin' who it is<br>
            I know that you'll thank God you did<br>
            I know where you been, where you are, where you goin' (yeah, yeah)<br>
            I know you're the reason I believe in life<br>
            What's the day without a little night?<br>
            I'm just tryna shed a little light<br>
            It can be hard<br>
            It can be so hard<br>
            But you gotta live right now<br>
            You got everything to give right now<br>
            I've been on the low<br>
            I been taking my time<br>
            I feel like I'm out of my mind<br>
            It feel like my life ain't mine<br>
            Who can relate? Woo<br>
            I've been on the low<br>
            I been taking my time<br>
            I feel like I'm out of my mind<br>
            It feel like my life ain't mine<br>
            I finally wanna be alive (finally wanna be alive)<br>
            I finally wanna be alive (hey)<br>
            I don't wanna die today<br>
            I don't wanna die<br>
            I finally wanna be alive (finally wanna be alive)<br>
            I finally wanna be alive (oh)<br>
            I don't wanna die (no, I don't wanna die)<br>
            I don't wanna die<br>
            (I just wanna live)<br>
            (I just wanna live)<br>
            Pain don't hurt the same, I know<br>
            The lane I travel feels alone<br>
            But I'm moving 'til my legs give out<br>
            And I see my tears melt in the snow<br>
            But I don't wanna cry<br>
            I don't wanna cry anymore<br>
            I wanna feel alive<br>
            I don't even wanna die anymore<br>
            Oh, I don't wanna<br>
            I don't wanna<br>
            I don't even wanna die anymore<br>

            The lyrics of Logic's song "1-800-273-8255" are an anthem for suicide prevention and emotional support for
            those struggling with depression and anxiety. The title of the song is the phone number for the National
            Suicide Prevention Lifeline in the United States, which offers free and confidential support to anyone in
            need.

            The protagonist reflects on their problems and the reasons why they feel so bad, but ultimately decides to
            call the suicide prevention hotline number. The song ends with the voice of a suicide prevention hotline
            operator talking to the protagonist and offering emotional support.

            The lyrics of the song are an invitation to not be ashamed to ask for help when struggling with depression
            and anxiety, and to seek support from friends, family, and mental health professionals. The song aims to
            convey the message that life can be difficult and painful at times, but there are resources available to
            help people overcome difficulties and live a happy and fulfilling life.
