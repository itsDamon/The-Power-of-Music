          And let me tell you why<br />
          All this other shit I'm talkin' 'bout, they think they know it<br />
          I've been prayin' for somebody to save me, no one's heroic<br />
          And my life don't even matter, I know it, I know it<br />
          I know I'm hurtin' deep down but can't show it<br />
          I never had a place to call my own<br />
          I never had a home, ain't nobody callin' my phone<br />
          Where you been? Where you at? What's on your mind?<br />
          They say every life precious but nobody care about mine<br />
          I've been on the low<br />
          I been taking my time<br />

          I want you to be alive<br />
          You don't gotta die today<br />
          You don't gotta die<br />
          I want you to be alive<br />
          I want you to be alive<br />
          You don't gotta die<br />
          Now let me tell you why<br />
          It's the very first breath<br />
          When your head's been drownin' underwater<br />
          And it's the lightness in the air<br />
          When you're there, chest to chest with a lover<br />
          It's holdin' on, though the road's long<br />
          And seein' light in the darkest things<br />
          And when you stare at your reflection, finally knowin' who it is<br />
          I know that you'll thank God you did<br />
          I know where you been, where you are, where you goin' (yeah, yeah)<br />
          I know you're the reason I believe in life<br />
          What's the day without a little night?<br />
          I'm just tryna shed a little light<br />
          It can be hard<br />
          It can be so hard<br />
          But you gotta live right now<br />
          You got everything to give right now<br />
          I've been on the low<br />
          I been taking my time<br />
          I feel like I'm out of my mind<br />
          It feel like my life ain't mine<br />
          Who can relate? Woo<br />
          I've been on the low<br />
          I been taking my time<br />
          I feel like I'm out of my mind<br />
          It feel like my life ain't mine<br />
          I finally wanna be alive (finally wanna be alive)<br />
          I finally wanna be alive (hey)<br />
          I don't wanna die today<br />
          I don't wanna die<br />
          I finally wanna be alive (finally wanna be alive)<br />
          I finally wanna be alive (oh)<br />
          I don't wanna die (no, I don't wanna die)<br />
          I don't wanna die<br />
          (I just wanna live)<br />
          (I just wanna live)<br />
          Pain don't hurt the same, I know<br />
          The lane I travel feels alone<br />
          But I'm moving 'til my legs give out<br />
          And I see my tears melt in the snow<br />
          But I don't wanna cry<br />
          I don't wanna cry anymore<br />
          I wanna feel alive<br />
          I don't even wanna die anymore<br />
          Oh, I don't wanna<br />
          I don't wanna<br />
          I don't even wanna die anymore<br />

          The lyrics of Logic's song "1-800-273-8255" are an anthem for suicide
          prevention and emotional support for those struggling with depression
          and anxiety. The title of the song is the phone number for the
          National Suicide Prevention Lifeline in the United States, which
          offers free and confidential support to anyone in need. The
          protagonist reflects on their problems and the reasons why they feel
          so bad, but ultimately decides to call the suicide prevention hotline
          number. The song ends with the voice of a suicide prevention hotline
          operator talking to the protagonist and offering emotional support.
          The lyrics of the song are an invitation to not be ashamed to ask for
          help when struggling with depression and anxiety, and to seek support
          from friends, family, and mental health professionals. The song aims
          to convey the message that life can be difficult and painful at times,
          but there are resources available to help people overcome difficulties
          and live a happy and fulfilling life.

        Anxiety and depression are two of the most common obstacles teens and
        young adults face and it’s beginning to take a serious toll in the
        classroom. Every year more cases of anxiety and depression are reported
        in children and teens. 1 in every 8 children has anxiety, according to
        the Anxiety and Depression Association of America (ADAA). While there
        are treatments for anxiety and depression, 80% of children with an
        anxiety disorder and 60% of children with depression are not receiving
        treatment. With so many children and teens who have undiagnosed anxiety
        or depression, this can negatively impact their ability to learn and
        enjoy their time in school. When students have anxiety and depression
        that goes unnoticed their mental health is at risk, which can lead to
        social and behavioral problems, poor performance and learning, neglected
        hygiene, poor self-care practices and low self-esteem. It can be
        difficult for teachers to identify anxiety and depression because these
        disorders often show up differently for different people, but this is
        why knowing the combinations of behaviors to look for is key. When
        anxiety and depression aren’t addressed, the symptoms can worsen,
        creating a vicious cycle that many students are finding themselves in.
        Unpredictable Behavior is Often a Sign of Anxiety or Depression Anxiety
        and depression can be tricky because they can cause students to act in
        unpredictable ways and teachers aren’t trained to recognize these cues.
        Anxiety and depression are complex disorders and how they affect people
        depends on many variables. One minute a student could seem fine and the
        next they may experience and outburst or panic attack. Teachers and
        staff need training to be able to properly handle these unexpected
        occurrences. What Causes Anxiety and Depression in Students? Doctors are
        still not sure if depression is passed on genetically or if it’s a
        mental illness that is solely psychological and physical. While
        scientists and doctors continue to explore this, there is evidence that
        suggests depression could be a combination of both nature and nurture.
        On the other hand, a number of variables can lead to an anxiety
        disorder. An anxiety disorder may be prevalent if the following occur:
        When a fear/worry about a particular event or area of life is present
        The fear/worry is extreme compared to that experienced by peers or it is
        age‐inappropriate The fear/worry leads to avoidance of events The
        fear/worry causes significant distress and/or interferes significantly
        in daily activities Since there are different kinds of anxiety, teachers
        should be trained to understand how to work effectively with each one.
        Common types of anxiety disorders are separation anxiety disorder,
        social phobia, generalized anxiety disorder, specific phobia, OCD, panic
        disorder and PTSD. Diet is Important to Mental Health Even factors like
        what you are eating can impact stress, anxiety and depression. It is
        extremely important for students to eat healthy meals regularly and pay
        attention to the ingredients in their food. Research has proven time and
        time again that what you eat affects your mood. Different food can even
        change the chemical balance of the body. For example, Tryptophan is
        found in poultry, oil-rich fish, beans, baked potatoes, oats, nuts and
        seeds and it aids in serotonin production, which helps regulate mood..
        Impact of Anxiety and Depression on Performance Depression and anxiety
        affect all areas of an individual’s well-being including sleep, diet,
        mental and physical health, self-esteem, social interaction and academic
        performance. Students who have these disorders are at risk of suffering
        from poor academic performance and resistance to anything school
        related. This can include lack of engagement in the classroom, poor
        relationships with peers and teachers, and disinterest in pursuing
        passions and planning for the future. Their learning is also affected
        due to the fact that anxiety and depression can impact the working
        memory, which makes it challenging to retain new information and recall
        previously learned information. Missing Class Can be a Sign of Anxiety
        These disorders can also lead to school refusal, or school phobia. This
        is when a student’s anxiety or depression is so severe that they begin
        avoiding going to school at all. This can begin with missing class,
        going home early, and staying home, but eventually can lead to school
        drop out.
