          Transmission third world war third round<br />
          A decade of the weapon of sound above ground<br />
          No shelter if you're lookin' for shade<br />
          I lick shots at the brutal charade<br />
          As the polls close like a casket<br />
          On truth devoured<br />
          A Silent play in the shadow of power<br />
          A spectacle monopolized<br />
          The camera's eyes on choice disguised<br />
          Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?<br />
          Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?<br />
          Yes a spectacle monopolized<br />
          They hold the reins and stole your eyes<br />
          Or the fistagons<br />
          The bullets and bombs<br />
          Who stuff the banks<br />
          Who staff the party ranks<br />
          More for Gore or the son of a drug lord<br />
          None of the above fuck it cut the cord<br />

          Way past the days of Bombin' M.C.'s<br />
          Sound off Mumia gwan be free<br />
          Who gottem yo check the federal file<br />
          All you pen devils know the trial was vile<br />
          An army of pigs try to silence my style<br />
          Off 'em all out that box<br />
          It's my radio dial<br />

          The song "Guerrilla Radio" by Rage Against the Machine is about the
          struggle of the oppressed in society and their struggle to make<br />
          their voice heard against the oppressors. The text implies a
          revolution of the silent masses,<br />
          and that the only way to make your voice heard is through a "guerrilla
          radio", or unconventional methods of communication.<br />
          In the song, the speaker encourages the listener to join their cause
          and use music and communication<br />
          as a means to free himself from the constraints of the "brutal farce".
          The song also serves as a call to arms,<br />
          urging the people to fight for what is right and establish an
          environment of equality.<br />
          The House adopted a non-binding resolution on the situation in the
          Middle East.<br />
          Finally, the song sends a message of hope, insisting that with the
          right tools and push, a revolution is possible and that "all hell
          cannot stop us now".<br />
