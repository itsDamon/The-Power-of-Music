          Transmission third world war third round<br>
          A decade of the weapon of sound above ground<br>
          No shelter if you're lookin' for shade<br>
          I lick shots at the brutal charade<br>
          As the polls close like a casket<br>
          On truth devoured<br>
          A Silent play in the shadow of power<br>
          A spectacle monopolized<br>
          The camera's eyes on choice disguised<br>
          Was it cast for the mass who burn and toil?<br>
          Or for the vultures who thirst for blood and oil?<br>
          Yes a spectacle monopolized<br>
          They hold the reins and stole your eyes<br>
          Or the fistagons<br>
          The bullets and bombs<br>
          Who stuff the banks<br>
          Who staff the party ranks<br>
          More for Gore or the son of a drug lord<br>
          None of the above fuck it cut the cord<br>
          Lights out<br>
          Guerrilla Radio, turn that shit up<br>

          Contact I highjacked the frequencies<br>
          Blockin' the beltway<br>
          Move on D.C.<br>
          Way past the days of Bombin' M.C.'s<br>
          Sound off Mumia gwan be free<br>
          Who gottem yo check the federal file<br>
          All you pen devils know the trial was vile<br>
          An army of pigs try to silence my style<br>
          Off 'em all out that box<br>
          It's my radio dial<br>
          Lights out<br>
          Guerrilla Radio, turn that shit up<br>

          The song "Guerrilla Radio" by Rage Against the Machine is about the struggle of the oppressed in society and their struggle to make<br>
          their voice heard against the oppressors. The text implies a revolution of the silent masses,<br>
          and that the only way to make your voice heard is through a "guerrilla radio", or unconventional methods of communication.<br>
          In the song, the speaker encourages the listener to join their cause and use music and communication<br>
          as a means to free himself from the constraints of the "brutal farce". The song also serves as a call to arms,<br>
          urging the people to fight for what is right and establish an environment of equality.<br>
          The House adopted a non-binding resolution on the situation in the Middle East.<br>
          Finally, the song sends a message of hope, insisting that with the right tools and push, a revolution is possible and that "all hell cannot stop us now".<br>
